They are the watchers in the North, and the sentinels of Eriador, a duty that sees them face the savage forces of Moria, Goblintown and Gundabad while combating a renewed Angmar. While they may not have the most diverse roster of their own, their chieftain Aragorn and his heirs inspire the mortal men of Middle-Earth to fight for them.\n\nCulture: Dúnedain\nDuring the twilight of Numenor, the nation split into two factions, the Faithful and the Kingsmen. The Faithful fled the island nation on seven ships and founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-Earth. Since then, they are largely acted as a bulwark against the Shadow, defending the West from the Enemy. Descended from Lost Numenor, the Dunedain nations are some of the most advanced mortal kingdoms among Middle-Earth.\n\nSpecial Features:\nSettlement Restoration:\nThe Northern Dúnedain can reconstruct Western Osgiliath, Annúminas and Fornost Erain\nBeacon of Hope:\nAs the beacon of hope for mortal men, Aragorn and his heirs inspires even those from foreign nations to fight for them. The Northern Dúnedain can recruit the forces of allied Good non-Numenorean nations using the mercenary mechanic. Evil mortal and other Numenorean nations require the Northern Dúnedain’s barracks to be built in those regions to recruit forces from those nations. If the Reunited Kingdom formed, the Northern Dúnedain lose access to this mechanic.\nLocal Militia:\nRather than having their own militia, the Northern Dúnedain rally local mortal militia to their banner through their barracks.\nAragorn’s Quest:\nAs a destined scion of Elendil’s line, Aragorn will be faced with his own quest. By following the event prompts that begin at Turn 5, you can eventually unlock the Army of the Dead, a nigh invincible army that will fight three battles for Aragorn before their oath is fulfilled and they are released. Aragorn’s quest will also allow him to decide between forming the Reunited Kingdom or reforging Arnor.\nThe Reunited Kingdom:\nBy declaring to form the Reunited Kingdom and completing Aragorn’s quest, the Northern Dúnedain will merge with Gondor and Dol Amroth (So long as you are allied to Gondor and Dol Amroth, and Gondor holds Minas Tirith) and Eastern Osgiliath will be rebuilt. While the Beacon of Hope mechanic will be removed due to the fear of the Reunited Kingdom by some as another imperialist power, you will unlock the Ancillary Barracks, a new building line that allows recruitment of powerful mortal units from other nations if you build it in their regions. You can also recruit Gondorian and Dol Amroth troops by building your barracks in their regions and gain access to Level 6 armour.\nArnor Reforged:\nBy either declaring to reforge Arnor as part of Aragorn’s quest, or by Aragorn himself dying before the Reunited Kingdom is formed, the Northern Dúnedain will be placed on the path to reforge Arnor. Once the House of Kings in Annúminas is rebuilt, so long as you are allied to Bree and Bree holds Bree itself, Arnor will be reforged. The Northern Dúnedain will merge with Bree and retain access to the Beacon of Hope mechanic. Furthermore, you will be able to recruit certain Bree units as follows: Greenway units from roads in regions where the Greenway ran historically, Gatekeepers from the Prancing Pony in Bree, and Watchmen units from your barracks in Bree regions. All Bree units also feature Arnorian visual upgrades. Reforming Arnor will also you to train the powerful Sworn Infantry and Horsemen from your barracks as your newfound resources allow you to outfit the local militia who flock to your banner with more elite equipment. You also unlock Level 5 armour.\nArnorian Troops:\nBy forming either the Reunited Kingdom or Arnor, you will unlock powerful Arnorian AoR troops (From their Arnorian homelands) and the Sons of Numenor (From either Minas Tirith or Annúminas). Defeating Angmar will also allow the recruitment of Rhuadaur troops once either nation is formed.\nHobbit Allies:\nThe Northern Dúnedain can recruit Bandobras Archers and Watch Shirriffs from Smials in Hobbit regions.\nGandalf:\nOnce a certain milestone in Aragorn’s quest is reached (Or Aragorn himself has perished), the Grey Wizard Gandalf will rally to aid the Northern Dúnedain once you have reached Turn 40. Furthermore, if Gandalf perishes, he may return as Gandalf the White.\nThe Barrow Downs:\nIf the Northern Dúnedain holds Mengalen, the Barrow Wights in the surrounding crypts will arise to terrorise the lands, seeking to drive those not sworn to Angmar from the lands. However, each Barrow Wight army defeated will bring greater security to the region and result in a population increase. Once Mengalen is upgraded to a town, the crypts can be restored, and securing the crypts allows the Northern Dúnedain to muster Dúnedain Steelbowmen from the region as a result of uncovering and restoring these weapons from the crypts and the battlefields surrounding them.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nAs a result of their scattered and disparate nature, the Northern Dúnedain must either form the Reunited Kingdom or reforge Arnor to unlock Cities, Large Cities and Strongholds. The Northern Dúnedain have regular access to Level 1-4 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 5 armour from blacksmiths if they reform Arnor, and can gain Level 5-6 armour if they form the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nThe Ring Script:\nAs one of the nations of the Free Peoples, the Northern Dúnedain can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples.',

            desc = 'Long we have remained hidden from the eyes of the Enemy, operating in the shadows, fighting His cause across Middle-earth for generations of our noble line. Many would accuse us of cowardice, of not living up to our responsibilities, but we face death each and every day, as we shield those unable to defend themselves. Some call us ‘Rangers’, as if it were a derogatory term. Whether it is from wolves, Trolls or worse – and there are things in the dark that make these foes pale by comparison, and we have met and faced them, now as in our past. Even our ancient dead have turned upon us, and our old world is but a memory, distant glories those of song and funeral dirge.\n\nWe preserve the bloodlines of old Númenor, of the four ships of Elendil that held much magnificence and hope in a day that is long past, appearing only in the embers of our dreams, in poetry and verse, in mouldering records kept in a few of the greater libraries of this world. For we hide the bloodlines of the Kings of Men, of the Kingdom of Arnor, the ill-fated realm that split into three at the death of the last King of Arnor, Eärendur. Although we hide, we turn the tide of war against our foe, and his eyes search everywhere for us, for he fears the blood of Númenor.\n\nGlorious was the Kingdom of Arnor, and those that followed, Arthedain in the west, that lay from Gil-galad’s gift of the White Towers of Elostirion by the River Lune, to the River Baranduin. Annúminas was theirs, as was the capital at Fornost Erain. Cardolan lay in the south of Arnor, between the Baranduin, through to the Greyflood, containing the Great East Road of Elf and Dwarf, in the now ruinous city of Tharbad, once great. Treacherous Rhudaur fell into shadow, but in its glory lay in the east, from the Weather Hills and Amon Sûl, where the three met, to the very borders of Imladris and the Misty Mountains.\n\nGreat was our history, too much to tell, of the Seven Kings of Arnor, and the palantír, the three, that caused much of our woes. There was jealousy there, and the Kingdoms of both Cardolan and Rhudaur greatly desired the seeing-stone of Amon Sûl, but it was denied them, even at the end. Even when Arvedui, King of Arthedain and his sons died at sea, with the loss of the two palantír of Amon Sûl and Annúminas. Malbeth the Seer predicted him the last of Arthedain, and his surviving son Aranarth took the Chieftainship of the Dúnedain in Exile, after plague, war and treachery, the Witch-king’s machinations, all failed to utterly destroy us. Still we live; between Lindon, Imladris and the North Downs we are scattered, and the traditions are all that hold us - that and the surviving blood of kings that runs in our chieftains.\n\nOhtar, Squire of Isildur, brought the Shards of Narsil to Imladris, where we added the Sceptre of Annúminas and the ancient Ring of Barahir, given unto the Edain in the times of the First Age in sign of the friendship of all Elves. A tradition began which saw our chieftains fostered in Imladris, to train in safety in their youth, so that they may yet unite the kingdoms of old reborn. The time has come, at last, for us to think of what was and make it so again. The wise still speak of a time when Cardolan, Arthedain and Rhudaur will be united and populated again, and the mistakes of our ancestors be wiped from history save as a reminder, a warning to those of future lines. We possess the one man who could unite the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor once more. His name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and his is the power that could overturn the Stewardship that has served Middle-earth well in the south, and announce to all the Return of the King. With trumpets and blazoned banners the Dúnedain will call the notes of dynasty that has long remained unheard. The Grey Company will ride in war, and all will fall before our irrepressible charge.\n\nThe way will not be of ease. We are comparatively few, and our allies may be the stronger part of our hope, yet there are enough to make our dreams true. There are others who will follow our early days in war, and they remember, but have lost hope – they remember the alliance that overthrew the Witch-king at Fornost, and will do their part again. The Elves, the folk of Bree-land, the scattered folk of Eregion. They will answer our call, and we may yet find allies in the Dwarves, for they are stronger than they fear they are not. The greater West is our land of friendship and alliance, trade is good, and the strength of Men is beyond recall. Together we will make songs of old live again, bring the words of poets out of the pages of books, and the memory of great Arnor will take form from all of this.\n\nOur Aragorn has fought in wars across Middle-earth, leading the sacking of Umbar, fighting in the armies of Gondor. He has ridden alongside our people in secrecy, his flashing blade carving the fury of lost times across the lines of our enemies. He has fought beside the folk of Elrond, has become great in wisdom and the art of war, and he has allies - the sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir are with us and any of us would die for him gladly, for he is a great man, and his destiny is larger than any chieftain before him. Days of glory await, and he truly has the strength to bring back the twin Kingdoms and best Sauron in his own lair of deepening Shadow.',

The Faithful stood in opposition to Ar-Pharazon, whereas the Kingsmen followed him, both in his worship of Melkor and unto Valinor itself. These Kingsmen lay claim to this tradition, and they have a firm belief in their own superiority, with some also rumoured to even continue the worship of Melkor.\n\nSpecial Features: \nGondor or Mordor Alliance choice: You can choose to ally with Mordor or Gondor; each alliance will give Ar- Adûnâim elite units of their respective ally with limited recruitability. Ending either alliance through war or any other means will cause the ally to stop sharing elite troops. (CAUTION: once alliance is ended, re-making that alliance will not bring back the recruitable troops-the trust is gone).\n\nMordor Alliance units are available from the final tier of the Dark Temples in city capital locations.\nGondor Alliance units are available from tier 3 barracks in city capital locations.\n\nHorde Start:\nAs an invading nation, foreign to Middle-Earth, the Ar-Ardunaim start as a horde and can chose to travel to anywhere in Middle-Earth to begin their conquest. Until you conquer your first region, you gain substantial income bonuses to offset the upkeep of your units. Furthermore, as complete and unknown outsiders, they also begin with neutral relations with every faction, allowing them to choose their allies and enemies.\n\nSubjugation:\nThe Ar-Ardunaim can construct both Conscription Camps and Barracks of True Sons that allow them to train local troops from the factions whose lands they conquer. Some of these units such as the Gondorian and Dol Amroth units will even have unique Ar-Ardunaim visuals.\nSettlement Restoration:\nThe Ar-Adûnâim are able to reconstruct Western Osgiliath, Eastern Osgiliath and Fornost Erain\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nThe Ar-Ardunaim have no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. They also have regular access to Level 1-5 armour from blacksmiths.\n\nThe Ring Script:\nThe Ar-Ardunaim can choose to retain the One Ring or return it to Sauron..',

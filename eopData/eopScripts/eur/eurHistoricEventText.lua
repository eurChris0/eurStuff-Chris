FACTION_INFO_GONDOR_BODY = [[The Kingdom of Gondor is one of the most powerful nations in Middle-Earth. Standing long against the Shadow of Mordor, they boast elite and powerful infantry, and diverse collection of troops that are recruited from their fiefdoms. Nevertheless, Gondor is also in decline and some fear the nation will not be able to stand against Mordor for much longer.

Culture: Dunedain
During the twilight of Numenor, the nation split into two factions, the Faithful and the Kingsmen. The Faithful fled the island nation on seven ships and founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-Earth. Since then, they are largely acted as a bulwark against the Shadow, defending the West from the Enemy. Descended from Lost Numenor, the Dunedain nations are some of the most advanced mortal kingdoms among Middle-Earth.

Special Features:
Settlement Restoration:
Gondor is able to reconstruct Western Osgiliath, Eastern Osgiliath and Fornost Erain.
Madness of Denethor:
Denethor throughout the campaign engages in a contest of will with Sauron through Gondor's Palantir. His mind will be weakened and turn to madness if key Gondorian cities are lost or his sons perish in battle, resulting in global debuffs for Gondor. Destroying Mordor, regardless of if it's through conquest or destroying the One Ring will end this script.
Fiefdom Recruitment:
Although Gondor's Fiefdom units are normally AoR, they can recruit a limited number of them by constructing a Fiefdom Barracks in Minas Tirith.

Building Limitations:
Gondor has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. Gondor has regular access to Level 1-5 armour from blacksmiths.

The Ring Script:
As one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Gondor can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples.

As one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Dol Amroth can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples. ]] FACTION_INFO_DA_TITLE = [[Faction Info: Dol Amroth ]] FACTION_INFO_ROHAN_BODY = [[Rohan, the Realm of the Horselords lies between Gondor and Mirkwood, standing strong as Gondor's closest friend and ally during these troubled times. And yet, internal discontent threatens to erode this bond, as Théoden languishes in Edoras, and foul rumours swirl around the court. And yet, if he recovers, Rohan will be in a position of strength to face the twin foes of Dunland and Isengard, with a wealthy economy, capable mounted forces and strong allies.

Culture: Northmen
Long ago, there was a Northmen kingdom in Rhovanion during the early Third Age. However, it was shattered during the invasions of the Wainriders and its people splintered. While some remained and went on to found the nation of Dale, others fled to the Vales of the Anduin under Marhwini son of Marhari and became the Éothéod. And it was a migration of the Éothéod to the south, where they were gifted lands by Gondor in exchange for their friendship and aid at the Battle of the Field of Celebrant that saw them become the Rohirrim. Although there may be great geographic distances between these kingdoms, they can all lay claim to the common heritage of Northmen.

Special Features:
Théoden's Fatigue:
Ensorcelled by the words of Grima Wormtongue, Théoden begins the game locked in Edoras and can barely move. However, this is not permanent and he will be unlocked at Turn 10.
Glittering Caves:
If Rohan holds Helm's Deep and is allied to either the Dwarves of Ered Luin or Erebor for 20 Turns, they will be able to construct a Dwarven Outpost in the caves, granting them access to the powerful Dwarven Guard of the Caves unit.

Building Limitations:
Rohan has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. Rohan has regular access to Level 1-3 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 4 armour from the Glittering Caves through Dwarven friendship.

As one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Rohan can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples. ]] FACTION_INFO_ROHAN_TITLE = [[Faction Info: Rohan ]] FACTION_INFO_BREE_BODY = [[Nestled in the heartlands of Eriador, Bree starts in a very well protected position. Natural defences dot the landscape, such as hills, rivers, and woodland. Bree do not have a formal military and they have very few units compared to most nations. Their only real strength comes in the assistance provided by the Dúnedain but they are restricted to only a few regions. In truth, Bree's military strategy is a defensive one, preferring holding units over attacking units and favouring infantry over cavalry.

Culture: Middlemen
The Middlemen of Eriador and Enedwaith are descended from the native inhabitants of Middle-Earth prior to the Numenorean conquests. Labelled thus by Numenor and divided into the more peaceful costal Middlemen of Bree and Enedwaith and the militaristic highland peoples of Dunland and Rhuadaur, they have endured much on account of the Men of Westernesse, and yet despite Numenor's sins, there are those who dwell peacefully among its descendants in Arnor and Gondor. And there are those who are ready to rise against the Faithful Kingdoms once more. Although they may lack the technology of other nations, they are capable men like any other and are ready to make their own choices and defend their homes.

Special Features:
Unconventional Recruitment:
Unlike the vast majority of factions in the game, Bree lacks a formal military and the infrastructure to support and recruit it. Instead, they recruit units from their economic buildings, such as farms and roads, among others.
Bree's Choice:
Around fifteen years into the game (sixty turns), Bree will be faced with either forsaking or becoming closer with the Dúnedain. Forsaking them allows Bree access to powerful buildings that allow the recruitment of every mercenary in the game, the ability to recruit certain dwarf units and artillery, and large cities, although you will lose access to Dúnedain units, and all existing units will leave your faction. Seeking closer bonds with the Dúnedain allows Bree to recruit more Dúnedain units, build highways, rebuild the Bridge of Tharbad and a higher tier blacksmith that provides an additional tier of armour, that also grants Greenway, Watchguard and the Gatekeepers Arnorian themed visual upgrades.
Hobbit Allies:
Bree can recruit Bandobras Archers and Watch Shirriffs from Smials in Hobbit regions.
The Barrow Downs:
If Bree holds Mengalen, the Barrow Wights in the surrounding crypts will arise to terrorise the lands, seeking to drive those not sworn to Angmar from the lands. However, each Barrow Wight army defeated will bring greater security to the region and result in a population increase. Once Mengalen is upgraded to a town, the crypts can be restored if Bree remains allied to the the Northern Dúnedain, and securing the crypts allows Bree to muster Dúnedain Steelbowmen from the region as a result of uncovering and restoring these weapons from the crypts and the battlefields surrounding them.

Building Limitations:
Bree can build all settlement tiers bar large cities. To unlock large cities, they must forsake the Dúnedain and chose to hire mercenaries in their choice script. Bree has regular access to Level 1-3 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 4 armour from blacksmiths if they side with the Northern Dúnedain in their choice script.

The Ring Script:
As one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Bree can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples. ]] FACTION_INFO_BREE_TITLE = [[Faction Info Bree ]] FACTION_INFO_ND_BODY = [[The Northern Dúnedain are a shattered and broken people but are still possessed of a hardy and stalwart spirit. They are the watchers in the North, and the sentinels of Eriador, a duty that sees them face the savage forces of Moria, Goblintown and Gundabad while combating a renewed Angmar. While they may not have the most diverse roster of their own, their chieftain Aragorn and his heirs inspire the mortal men of Middle-Earth to fight for them.

Culture: Dúnedain
During the twilight of Numenor, the nation split into two factions, the Faithful and the Kingsmen. The Faithful fled the island nation on seven ships and founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-Earth. Since then, they are largely acted as a bulwark against the Shadow, defending the West from the Enemy. Descended from Lost Numenor, the Dunedain nations are some of the most advanced mortal kingdoms among Middle-Earth.

Special Features:
Settlement Restoration:
The Northern Dúnedain can reconstruct Western Osgiliath, Annúminas and Fornost Erain
Beacon of Hope:
As the beacon of hope for mortal men, Aragorn and his heirs inspires even those from foreign nations to fight for them. The Northern Dúnedain can recruit the forces of allied Good non-Numenorean nations using the mercenary mechanic. Evil mortal and other Numenorean nations require the Northern Dúnedain's barracks to be built in those regions to recruit forces from those nations. If the Reunited Kingdom formed, the Northern Dúnedain lose access to this mechanic.
Local Militia:
Rather than having their own militia, the Northern Dúnedain rally local mortal militia to their banner through their barracks.
Aragorn's Quest:
As a destined scion of Elendil's line, Aragorn will be faced with his own quest. By following the event prompts that begin at Turn 5, you can eventually unlock the Army of the Dead, a nigh invincible army that will fight three battles for Aragorn before their oath is fulfilled and they are released. Aragorn's quest will also allow him to decide between forming the Reunited Kingdom or reforging Arnor.
The Reunited Kingdom:
By declaring to form the Reunited Kingdom and completing Aragorn's quest, the Northern Dúnedain will merge with Gondor and Dol Amroth (So long as you are allied to Gondor and Dol Amroth, and Gondor holds Minas Tirith) and Eastern Osgiliath will be rebuilt. While the Beacon of Hope mechanic will be removed due to the fear of the Reunited Kingdom by some as another imperialist power, you will unlock the Ancillary Barracks, a new building line that allows recruitment of powerful mortal units from other nations if you build it in their regions. You can also recruit Gondorian and Dol Amroth troops by building your barracks in their regions and gain access to Level 6 armour.
Arnor Reforged:
By either declaring to reforge Arnor as part of Aragorn's quest, or by Aragorn himself dying before the Reunited Kingdom is formed, the Northern Dúnedain will be placed on the path to reforge Arnor. Once the House of Kings in Annúminas is rebuilt, so long as you are allied to Bree and Bree holds Bree itself, Arnor will be reforged. The Northern Dúnedain will merge with Bree and retain access to the Beacon of Hope mechanic. Furthermore, you will be able to recruit certain Bree units as follows: Greenway units from roads in regions where the Greenway ran historically, Gatekeepers from the Prancing Pony in Bree, and Watchmen units from your barracks in Bree regions. All Bree units also feature Arnorian visual upgrades. Reforming Arnor will also you to train the powerful Sworn Infantry and Horsemen from your barracks as your newfound resources allow you to outfit the local militia who flock to your banner with more elite equipment. You also unlock Level 5 armour.
Arnorian Troops:
By forming either the Reunited Kingdom or Arnor, you will unlock powerful Arnorian AoR troops (From their Arnorian homelands) and the Sons of Numenor (From either Minas Tirith or Annúminas). Defeating Angmar will also allow the recruitment of Rhuadaur troops once either nation is formed.
Hobbit Allies:
The Northern Dúnedain can recruit Bandobras Archers and Watch Shirriffs from Smials in Hobbit regions.
Gandalf:
Once a certain milestone in Aragorn's quest is reached (Or Aragorn himself has perished), the Grey Wizard Gandalf will rally to aid the Northern Dúnedain once you have reached Turn 40. Furthermore, if Gandalf perishes, he may return as Gandalf the White.
The Barrow Downs:
If the Northern Dúnedain holds Mengalen, the Barrow Wights in the surrounding crypts will arise to terrorise the lands, seeking to drive those not sworn to Angmar from the lands. However, each Barrow Wight army defeated will bring greater security to the region and result in a population increase. Once Mengalen is upgraded to a town, the crypts can be restored, and securing the crypts allows the Northern Dúnedain to muster Dúnedain Steelbowmen from the region as a result of uncovering and restoring these weapons from the crypts and the battlefields surrounding them.

Building Limitations:
As a result of their scattered and disparate nature, the Northern Dúnedain must either form the Reunited Kingdom or reforge Arnor to unlock Cities, Large Cities and Strongholds. The Northern Dúnedain have regular access to Level 1-4 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 5 armour from blacksmiths if they reform Arnor, and can gain Level 5-6 armour if they form the Reunited Kingdom.

The Ring Script:
As one of the nations of the Free Peoples, the Northern Dúnedain can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples. ]] FACTION_INFO_ND_TITLE = [[Faction Info: Northern Dúnedain ]] FACTION_INFO_DALE_BODY = [[Standing strong and renewed in the north is the Kingdom of Dale. A proud kingdom, recently re-established by Bard after the Battle of the Five Armies and the death of Smaug, they can count upon many firm allies, such as Erebor, the Woodland Realm and Dorwinion to make up for their poor financial conditions at the beginning of the game. Their own forces are also capable, with fine infantry and deadly archers. Dale stands as the bastion of mortal men in Rhovanion and is ready to combat the forces of Gundabad, Dol Guldur and the Confederation of Rhûn.

Culture: Northmen
Long ago, there was a Northmen kingdom in Rhovanion during the early Third Age. However, it was shattered during the invasions of the Wainriders and its people splintered.

Special Features:
Old Alliances:
From Dale's town halls in their homelands, they can muster troops from their allies, Erebor and the Woodland Realm. However, if these alliances are broken, these troops will no longer be able to be trained.

Special Features:
Split Barracks System:
As the Vale of the Anduin, you must choose which people you dedicate a region to, where it be the Woodsmen skilled in archery, the capable infantry of the Beornings or the deadly cavalry of the Éothéod by building their barracks there. Building such a barracks prevents the recruitment of the other two peoples in that region but allows you access to the powerful troops of the people you selected. This choice is per region.
The Mountain Passes:
To unlock their building restrictions, the Vale of the Anduin must hold open the passes of the Misty Mountains and build a series of powerful fortifications to ensure travel is not restricted and there can be economic prosperity. Once enough have been built, you will unlock full access to all settlement tiers.
AoR Units:
In Fenholm, you can train Stoor Sherrifs, and if you conquer Dol Guldur, you can train Silvan Marchwardens as a reward for cleansing the foul hill.

Dorwinion's Choice:
By reclaiming Mornedhel the remainder of Dorwinion's Avari allies will be convinced to aid the realm militarily. Dorwinion must then chose whether they will be enlisted as troops or whether they will aid as smiths and craftsmen. Allowing the Avari to serve as soldiers will grant you access to their elites as your late game roster, although they have long replenishment, and allow you to upgrade your units with Avari armour. Dedicating them to the economy however will mean your late game roster will be made up of mortal men, less capable than the Avari but with a faster replenishment. This choice is global, and the units are mutually exclusive- you must choose between your late game elites being either the Avari or men. However, a small army of the side you didn't select will spawn for you several turns after you have made the choice to aid your cause. You will be able to retrain this force through either the Windan Palace for the Avari, or the Avari Academy for the Northmen contingent.

Favouring manoeuvrability over defence, they have the deadliest of all Dwarven charges and their skill with their weapons is unmatched. Further still, the army of Erebor fields no archers or crossbows and instead favours the lethal Dwarven throwing axe. Allies from the Orocarni do still fight at range and a wise commander adopts both Erebor's offensive stance with support from the more defensive Orocarni.

Dwarves are the sons and daughters of Aulë and are among the hardiest of the inhabitants of Middle-Earth.

Special Features:
Grudges:
If the ancestral Dwarven homes are not controlled by any of the Dwarven kingdoms, their leaders will suffer penaltys until those settlements are under Dwarven control. The settlements are Erebor, Dain's Halls, Gundabad, and Khazad-Dûm. If in the hands of the Dwarf kingdoms, the leaders will receive bonuses.

The Dwarven Rings:
Sometime into the game, you will be given a choice to accept the three Dwarven rings in return for neutrality with the world. If you reject the rings, you will unlock a unique tier of port and gain access to an elven unit, King's Mounted Hammerguard, Mithril Guard (restricted to Thorin's Hall, Fahamgathol and Khazad Dum) and the campaign will play out normally. If you accept the rings, you will instantly become neutral with everyone and unlock the Grimborn Reavers and Azog Defilers. Some turns later, you will be attacked by the High Elves or the Dúnedain. If you survive, you will then be attacked by Erebor and Khazad-dûm unless you forge an alliance with them (the ones you ally won't attack you). If you survive, then the quest ends and you must reap the consequences of your actions.
Buzra-Dûm Reclamation:
Should you reclaim Buzra-Dûm from the foul orcs that have settled there, you may uncover the vaults to access vast wealth.

Boasting Middle-earths' best cavalry, infantry, and archers, it is hard to see how any nation will hold back the High Elves. Unfortunately, the same conditions that have bred this excellent class of warrior have also caused the decline of their population and Imladris and Lindon cannot field large armies at any time, as troops either perish or leave into the West.

Elves are the firstborn and are among the eldest of the races still in Middle-Earth.

Yet those who remain are firmly committed to fighting the Enemy. There is one final house however, the Avari, or Dark Elves, of the East. None among them feel the call to Valinor, for they refused it long ago, and legends claim they are both cruel and kind, friendly and isolationist.

Both Elrond and Cirdan serve as the faction leaders of the High Elves, meaning the faction will always have two leaders instead of one.
Unconventional Recruitment:
Lindar Barracks can only be built on coasts or major rivers. Noldor Barracks can only be built in hill, mountain or grassland regions (after Ost-in-Edhil is reclaimed). Higher tier units also require the Jewel Guild to be rebuilt (such as Moon Guard, Storm Guard, Elderinwe units)

Elves are the firstborn and are among the eldest of the races still in Middle-Earth. With thousands of years to perfect their skills, both female and male elves are equally deadly and beautiful but are stricken with melancholy and fey moods.

Yet those who remain are firmly committed to fighting the Enemy. There is one final house however, the Avari, or Dark Elves, of the East. None among them feel the call to Valinor, for they refused it long ago, and legends claim they are both cruel and kind, friendly and isolationist.

The Fourth Kinslaying(Supreme Power): you will be able to become the single ruler of the all High Elves: capture 17 provinces and not earlier than in 60 turns you will be given a choice.Win the War(destroy the High Elves, capture Mithlond and Imladris) and you will get the whole roster of them and be able to build High King Throne in Ost-In-Edhil

- Moon Temple: after the war has finished you will be able to build the Moon Temple in Mithlond: it will grant you very good benefits.

- Gwaith-i-Mírdain: You can rebuild the Jewel Guild in Ost-In-Edhil. This will grant you the ability to recruit Eregion Smiths in Ost-In-Edhil and level 6 armour upgrade.

Avengers Order and Alliance with dwarves of Khazad-Dum: Gwaith-i-Mirdain also opens up the possibility to build the Eregion Avengers Order which gives you the highest quality armour(7th level) and powerful Eregion Avengers and Silver Guard to recruit, but only if you capture West Khazad-Dum and give it to the dwarves.

Eleven years into the game (Or 45 turns) if you are allied with the Woodland Realm or you ally with them after turn 45, you will be warned of a powerful invading army coming from Mordor that will attack Caras Galadhon. The Woodland Realm will offer to send a host from Mirkwood to aid in the defence. Should you accept this aid, a company of warriors will reinforce the golden woods. However, should you decline his help, you will then stand alone with no reinforcements. After the battle, you can then choose to merge your nation with the Woodland Realm.

The Woodland Realm relies heavily on archers and ranged units, as they recruit these units quickly and in quantity and quality, for the Silvan elves are more numerous than either the Noldor or Telari, although not as skilled. For instance, they have average infantry, until they muster their hardened, elder elites that can hold their own against most enemy troops. They are lacking in cavalry with only two options, both of which are designed to skirmish with the enemy, not engage in prolonged melee.

The clans rely heavily on ambush and guerrilla warfare: being neither the most numerous nor the strongest of people in Middle-earth. Their poor technological state and dis-unified nation leaves them outmatched by almost all other forces initially. The free folk of Enedwaith do have one strength: their javelins. No other nation fields such deadly javelin throwers and even the walking immortals known as Eregion Smiths will fall like flowers before the hail of Enedwaith javelins.

Culture: Middlemen
The Middlemen of Eriador and Enedwaith are descended from the native inhabitants of Middle-Earth prior to the Numenorean conquests. Labelled thus by Numenor and divided into the more peaceful costal Middlemen of Bree and Enedwaith and the militaristic highland peoples of Dunland and Rhuadaur, they have endured much on account of the Men of Westernesse, and yet despite Numenor's sins, there are those who dwell peacefully among its descendants in Arnor and Gondor. And there are those who are ready to rise against the Faithful Kingdoms once more. Although they may lack the technology of other nations, they are capable men like any other and are ready to make their own choices and defend their homes.

Special Features:
Unconventional Recruitment:
At the start of the game, Enedwaith lacks a conventional military and infrastructure. Like Bree, they must initially rely on their economic buildings to recruit their militia and weaker units. However, their more powerful units and elites come from the Clanmoot Mustering Ground and Barracks.
Confederation of Athámor:
By reclaiming lands in Enedwaith and Dunland you can reforge the Confederation of Athámor this will unlock cities, large cities, strongholds, the third tier of blacksmiths, and your most elite units. The regions you must reclaim, and hold are: Lugiu (Seat of the Mocháini), Maolfinn (Seat of the Líadan), Cairill (Seat of the Mordag), Heorotscir (Seat of the Faolan), Maolrunaidh (Seat of the Keefei), Angren Bay (Seat of the Báirseach), Caladir (Seat of the Fylani), and Eryn Vorn (Great Circle of the Dubhsìthe), Larfearann, Dunland Lowlands, Dunland Border, Dunland Proper and Saralainn. Additionally, Tharbad must be occupied and the Tir Crocoil constructed in it to reforge the nation. Reclaiming regions with Clanseats will also provide you with more powerful troops and allies from those clans, and conquering Dunland will allow you to recruit Dunlending troops from those regions.

Building Limitations:
Enedwaith cannot build cities/large cities/strongholds at the beginning of the game due to their inferior technological status and the fracutured and ununified nature of their nation. Unifying Enedwaith and reforging the Confederation of Athámor by rebuilding the Tir Crocoil will unlock these tiers. Enedwaith also begins the game with regular access to Level 1-2 armour from blacksmiths, completing their script unlocks Level 3 armour and the third tier of blacksmith.

The Ring Script:
As one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Enedwaith can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples.

And there are those who are ready to rise against the Faithful Kingdoms once more. Although they may lack the technology of other nations, they are capable men like any other and are ready to make their own choices and defend their homes.

Special Features:
Split Barracks System:
As Dunland, you must choose which people you dedicate a region to, where it be the mounted troops of the Frekkalingir or the hard-hitting ranged forces of the Dunhird by building their barracks there. Building such a barracks prevents the recruitment of the force you don't select in that region but allows you access to the powerful troops of the people you selected. You are able to train your Dunlending and King's Warband units regardless of the choice you make. This choice is per region.
Dunlending Allies:
Constructing Dunhird barracks in Enedwaith regions allows the recruitment of certain Enedwaith units and constructing Frekkalingir barracks in Rohan regions allows the recruitment of certain Rohirric units.
The Vengeance Pact:
Dunland has sworn to enact vengeance against is foe of Rohan, and to reclaim the Kingship of Calenardhon in the name of Wulf's Line, and Saruman has promised them aid. By holding 8 Regions by Turn 80, Dunland will prove itself to Isengard and receive the ability to train Orthanc Guard and Wardens from your capital landmark buildings (High Brenin's Roost and Wulf's Hall in Edoras once it is constructed). Conquering Helm's Deep will then allow Dunland to train Wulfguard units from special landmarks across the map and allow them access to advance blacksmith functionality and special visual upgrades for the Wulfguard units. Taking Edoras and constructing Wulf's Hall on top of Meduseld will unlock the Heralds of the Twofold King and Dunland's building restrictions
Dunnish Superiority:
If you fail to hold 8 regions by Turn 80 or backstab Isengard, Saruman will abandon you and will unleash an Uruk tide out of the gates of Isengard to crush Dunland and Rohan alike. You can continue the script but are tasked with capturing Isengard instead of Helm's Deep (which unlocks the recruitment of Wulfguard units from landmarks, advance blacksmith functionality and their visual upgrade) and will then be tasked with reclaiming Edoras as normal. You will be unable to recruit Orthanc Guard and Wardens from your capital landmarks but can still recruit some from Isengard. There are no unique rewards from this route.
General Spawns:
Holding 5, 7 and 8 regions will spawn custom generals under your command. The third general that spawns is a reward for taking these 8 regions by turn 80 and remaining loyal to Isengard.

Building Limitations:
Dunland initially does not have access to Cities/Large Cities/Strongholds. To unlock them, they must complete their script by reclaiming the Kingship of Calenardhon and constructing Wulf's Hall in Edoras. Dunland also has regular access to Level 1-3 armour from blacksmiths, and unlocks their Level 4 armour through their script.

The Ring Script:

These formidable warriors wear heavy armour to keep them protected against any threat and this keen understanding of armour is also displayed in the multitude of anti-armour units Saruman fields for war.

Culture: Shadow of Melkor
Followers of the Shadow of Melkor are those who claim fealty to the Dark Powers themselves, as represented in Middle-Earth by Sauron himself. While most are orcs, having been first shaped by Melkor, some men such as the Angmarim also pay homage to these dark powers. Those who follow the Shadow of Melkor can join in invasions but also must answer to Sauron himself.

Special Features:
Saruman of Many Colours:
Unlike many factions in the game, Isengard has unique and special benefits for claiming the One Ring for themselves. If Saruman is the one who finds and claims the One Ring, he will become Saruman of Many Colours, and the Nazgûl will slowly be dominated by his will and fall under Isengard's control. The powerful Nazg-Hai unit will also be available for recruitment.
March of the Ents:
There are whispers in the forest that the Ents do not take kindly to Saruman's new age of order. As Isengard expands, it is almost certain they will march against progress. Take note, and be prepared for this attack, lest they succeed in their goal of seizing the Orthanc Tower.

Building Limitations:

Culture: Shadow of Melkor
Followers of the Shadow of Melkor are those who claim fealty to the Dark Powers themselves, as represented in Middle-Earth by Sauron himself. While most are orcs, having been first shaped by Melkor, some men such as the Angmarim also pay homage to these dark powers. Those who follow the Shadow of Melkor can join in invasions but also must answer to Sauron himself.

Special Features:
Scavengers:
In historical Dwarven mansions, Gundabad can construct Avenger's Guilds, which allow the recruitment of Orc Avengers, and also provide both melee weapon and armour upgrades to your units. These regions include Khazad-dûm West and East, Erebor, Kirikhgathol, Dain's Halls, Fahamgathol, Thorin's Halls and Buzra-dûm. Long occupied by the orcs, there is little left to scavenge in Gundabad itself.
Orcish Subjugation:
As the self-proclaimed Chosen of Melkor, the snow orcs of Gundabad seek to subjugate Middle-Earth and their rivals. By conquering the capitals of certain evil nations, they unlock the ability to train troops from those nations from those capitals. These nations include Angmar, Moria, Isengard, Dol Guldur and Mordor.

Building Limitations:
Gundabad has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. Gundabad has regular access to Level 1-3 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 4 armour from the third tier of Avenger's Guilds.

The Ring Script:
Gundabad can either return the ring to Mordor by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Morannon, or they can betray and forsake Mordor and chose to keep the ring for themselves. ]] FACTION_INFO_GUNDABAD_TITLE = [[Faction Info: Gundabad ]] FACTION_INFO_HARAD_BODY = [[Harad represents a diverse confederation of the tribes of both Near and Far Harad, bound by their shared loyalty to Sauron and Mordor. Ranging from the Muhad to the Trollmen and even the secretive Hasharii, Harad can field diverse armies, made up of capable cavalry and the feared mumakil.

Culture: Men of the East
To the east and south of Middle-Earth, there are a diverse set of peoples, united by their loyalties, to Sauron, whether it is compelled or voluntary. They include the Tribes of Harad, the Great Houses of Khand and the Confederation of Rhûn, and even peoples more unknown further to the east. While most also worship either Sauron or Melkor, there are also diverse local cults such as mystery cults rumoured to have been founded by the Blue Wizards or the infamous Dragon Cult of Rhûn.

Special Features:
Gather the Tribes:
Harad does not begin with full access to their roster. Rather, by taking regions, they slowly unlock their elite units by proving their strength to the tribes of Harad. Taking four regions unlocks the Muahd Tribesmen, eight regions unlock the Trollmen of Far Harad, twelve regions unlock the secretive Hasharii and fifteen regions finally unlocks the fearsome mumakil. Losing these regions does not result in these units becoming locked off

Harad cannot initially build large cities or strongholds due to their inferior construction methods, and their greater nomadic and non-sedentary traditions. However, fully gathering the tribes unlocks these tiers. Harad also has regular access to Level 1-3 armour from blacksmiths.

And yet, there are also whispers of rogue clans, led by the Blue Wizards, who have turned against the Dark Tower. Regardless, Khand's hordes of cavalry a truly a force to be feared.

To the east and south of Middle-Earth, there are a diverse set of peoples, united by their loyalties, to Sauron, whether it is compelled or voluntary. They include the Tribes of Harad, the Great Houses of Khand and the Confederation of Rhûn, and even peoples more unknown further to the east. While most also worship either Sauron or Melkor, there are also diverse local cults such as mystery cults rumoured to have been founded by the Blue Wizards or the infamous Dragon Cult of Rhûn. Uniquely, Khand can switch to Nomadic culture, forsaking Sauron in favour of their local traditions and faiths.

Special Features:
The Blue Wizards:
To the east of Middle-earth are the heartlands of Khand, and there are rumours that some clans have turned against Sauron, led by the Blue Wizards. This decision will eventually present itself to the main horde of Khand sometime after the beginning of the game, and they must decide whether to forsake their dark lord or not. Remaining loyal to Sauron will allow them to recruit Mordor's Temple units and muster the Great Beasts in their capital, Sturlurtsa Khand and key Numenorean and Elven regions. Whereas, rebelling against Sauron in favour of the Blue Wizards will allow them to muster the Orocarni Dwarves in their native homelands on the eastern edge of the map and the Uushixià Stormriders. Attacking Sauron before this choice presents itself will align Khand with the Blue Wizards and trigger the script early
Horde Start:
At the beginning of the game, Khand will be given the choice to start as a horde. If this choice is accepted, Khand will be locked to the Mordor route of the Blue Wizards script and will gain the services of the Temple units and can ride as a horde to conquer the Free Peoples. Khand must reject this start if they wish to rebel against Sauron.

Building Limitations:
Khand has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. Khand also has regular access to Level 1-3 armour from blacksmiths.

The Ring Script:
As a tribute nation to Mordor, Khand can either return the ring to Mordor by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Morannon, or they can betray and forsake Mordor and chose to keep the ring for themselves. If Khand rebels against Sauron, they will also be able to destroy the ring instead. ]] FACTION_INFO_KHAND_TITLE = [[Faction Info: Khand ]] FACTION_INFO_AA_BODY = [[The Ar-Adûnâim are the true Black Numenoreans, who hail from their colonies far to the south of Middle-Earth. Wielding some of the most elite and well armoured mortal infantry in the world, they are a force unto themselves, answering to no one but their king.

Culture: Kingsmen
During the twilight of Numenor, the nation split into two factions, the Faithful and the Kingsmen. The Faithful stood in opposition to Ar-Pharazon, whereas the Kingsmen followed him, both in his worship of Melkor and unto Valinor itself. These Kingsmen lay claim to this tradition, and they have a firm belief in their own superiority, with some also rumoured to even continue the worship of Melkor.

Special Features:

Gondor or Mordor Alliance choice: You can choose to ally with Mordor or Gondor; each alliance will give Ar- Adûnâim elite units of their respective ally with limited recruitability. Ending either alliance through war or any other means will cause the ally to stop sharing elite troops. (CAUTION: once alliance is ended, re-making that alliance will not bring back the recruitable troops-the trust is gone).

Mordor Alliance units are available from the final tier of the Dark Temples in city capital locations.
Gondor Alliance units are available from tier 3 barracks in city capital locations.

Horde Start:
As an invading nation, foreign to Middle-Earth, the Ar-Ardunaim start as a horde and can chose to travel to anywhere in Middle-Earth to begin their conquest. Until you conquer your first region, you gain substantial income bonuses to offset the upkeep of your units. Furthermore, as complete and unknown outsiders, they also begin with neutral relations with every faction, allowing them to choose their allies and enemies.
Subjugation:
The Ar-Ardunaim can construct both Conscription Camps and Barracks of True Sons that allow them to train local troops from the factions whose lands they conquer. Some of these units such as the Gondorian and Dol Amroth units will even have unique Ar-Ardunaim visuals.
Settlement Restoration:
The Ar-Adûnâim are able to reconstruct Western Osgiliath, Eastern Osgiliath and Fornost Erain

Building Limitations:
The Ar-Ardunaim have no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. They also have regular access to Level 1-5 armour from blacksmiths.

Culture: Dunedain
During the twilight of Numenor, the nation split into two factions, the Faithful and the Kingsmen.

And yet, if he recovers, Rohan will be in a position of strength to face the twin foes of Dunland and Isengard, with a wealthy economy, capable mounted forces and strong allies.

Culture: Northmen
Long ago, there was a Northmen kingdom in Rhovanion during the early Third Age. However, it was shattered during the invasions of the Wainriders and its people splintered. While some remained and went on to found the nation of Dale, others fled to the Vales of the Anduin under Marhwini son of Marhari and became the Éothéod.

Natural defences dot the landscape, such as hills, rivers, and woodland. Bree do not have a formal military and they have very few units compared to most nations. Their only real strength comes in the assistance provided by the Dúnedain but they are restricted to only a few regions. In truth, Bree's military strategy is a defensive one, preferring holding units over attacking units and favouring infantry over cavalry.

Culture: Middlemen
The Middlemen of Eriador and Enedwaith are descended from the native inhabitants of Middle-Earth prior to the Numenorean conquests. Labelled thus by Numenor and divided into the more peaceful costal Middlemen of Bree and Enedwaith and the militaristic highland peoples of Dunland and Rhuadaur, they have endured much on account of the Men of Westernesse, and yet despite Numenor's sins, there are those who dwell peacefully among its descendants in Arnor and Gondor. And there are those who are ready to rise against the Faithful Kingdoms once more. Although they may lack the technology of other nations, they are capable men like any other and are ready to make their own choices and defend their homes.

Unconventional Recruitment:
Unlike the vast majority of factions in the game, Bree lacks a formal military and the infrastructure to support and recruit it. Instead, they recruit units from their economic buildings, such as farms and roads, among others.
Hobbit Allies:
Bree can recruit Bandobras Archers and Watch Shirriffs from Smials in Hobbit regions.
The Barrow Downs:
If Bree holds Mengalen, the Barrow Wights in the surrounding crypts will arise to terrorise the lands, seeking to drive those not sworn to Angmar from the lands. However, each Barrow Wight army defeated will bring greater security to the region and result in a population increase. Once Mengalen is upgraded to a town, the crypts can be restored if Bree remains allied to the the Northern Dúnedain, and securing the crypts allows Bree to muster Dúnedain Steelbowmen from the region as a result of uncovering and restoring these weapons from the crypts and the battlefields surrounding them.

Allowing the Avari to serve as soldiers will grant you access to their elites as your late game roster, although they have long replenishment, and allow you to upgrade your units with Avari armour.

Elves are the firstborn and are among the eldest of the races still in Middle-Earth. With thousands of years to perfect their skills, both female and male elves are equally deadly and beautiful but are stricken with melancholy and fey moods. Of the Three Great Houses that remain in Middle-Earth many of the Noldor and Sindar of the High Elves of Eriador are departing into the West, leaving the Silvan Elves of the Woodland Realm, and there are even those among them who depart, leaving Middle-Earth a darker place.

The Fourth Kinslaying: you will be able to become the single ruler of the all High Elves: capture 17 provinces and not earlier than in 60 turns you will be given a choice.

- Moon Temple: after the war has begun you will be able to build the Moon Temple in Mithlond: it will grant you very good benefits.

- Gwaith-i-Mírdain: You can rebuild the Jewel Guild in Ost-In-Edhil. This will grant you the ability to recruit Eregion Smiths in Ost-In-Edhil and level 6 armour upgrade.

Avengers Order and Alliance with dwarves of Khazad-Dum: Gwaith-i-Mirdain also opens up the possibility to build the Eregion Avengers Order which gives you the highest quality armour(7th level) and powerful Eregion Avengers to recruit, but only if you capture West Khazad-Dum and give it to the dwarves.

Special Features:
Unconventional Recruitment:
At the start of the game, Enedwaith lacks a conventional military and infrastructure. Like Bree, they must initially rely on their economic buildings to recruit their militia and weaker units. However, their more powerful units and elites come from the Clanmoot Mustering Ground and Barracks.
Confederation of Athámor:
By reclaiming lands in Enedwaith and Dunland you can reforge the Confederation of Athámor this will unlock cities, large cities, strongholds, the third tier of blacksmiths, and your most elite units.

Additionally, Tharbad must be occupied and the Tir Crocoil constructed in it to reforge the nation. Reclaiming regions with Clanseats will also provide you with more powerful troops and allies from those clans, and conquering Dunland will allow you to recruit Dunlending troops from those regions.

Building Limitations:
Enedwaith cannot build cities/large cities/strongholds at the beginning of the game due to their inferior technological status and the fracutured and ununified nature of their nation. Unifying Enedwaith and reforging the Confederation of Athámor by rebuilding the Tir Crocoil will unlock these tiers.

Special Features:
Split Barracks System:
As Dunland, you must choose which people you dedicate a region to, where it be the mounted troops of the Frekkalingir or the hard-hitting ranged forces of the Dunhird by building their barracks there. Building such a barracks prevents the recruitment of the force you don't select in that region but allows you access to the powerful troops of the people you selected. You are able to train your Dunlending and King's Warband units regardless of the choice you make. This choice is per region.
Dunlending Allies:
Constructing Dunhird barracks in Enedwaith regions allows the recruitment of certain Enedwaith units and constructing Frekkalingir barracks in Rohan regions allows the recruitment of certain Rohirric units. Conquering Isengard will allow you to train the powerful Orthanc Guard and Wardens, and powerful generals will slowly join you as you conquer more regions.
The Vengeance Pact:
Dunland has sworn to enact vengeance against is foe of Rohan, and to reclaim the Kingship of Calenardhon in the name of Wulf's Line.

For many years we have fought and squabbled among ourselves, seeking only the riches and gold of each other. Petty Kingdoms and Great Cities alike burnt each other's crops and looted each other's vassals. Once we had been united a Númenóreans all but that unity splintered when the Great Betrayer Sauron led the Golden One astray down the path of ruin. With the ruin of Númenor, its great colonies fractured as their lords, man and woman alike, sought to claim the crown. Alas, little but blood and ruin came of those attempts and after many years the kingdoms realized there would be little chance of a leader with a strong claim emerging, and so, agreed to an uneasy truce, each tolerating the sovereignty of the others.

There was once a chance of unity, when the Faithful King, Tarannon Falastur sought to parley with us. The many nations acted as one and we sent a noble lady, Berúthiel, who held the closest ties that could be found to the Golden One, in an attempt to place a King's Woman on the throne of a united New Númenor, for she would control the weak King and operate as the power behind the throne. Sadly, the plans were ruined by a meddling Steward and the union of the lands never came to pass; and so, Berúthiel was exiled. Ironically, she returned bearing the child of the King. By exiling her, Tarannon Falastur had guaranteed that he would never have an heir. Although one named Castamir would later claim the throne as a Black Númenorean, he had little relation to us, and was only a fool of Gondor that used our name without knowing its true meaning.

Almost two thousand years passed before we would be united under a single purpose again; a young lord named Gimilkhâd came before the annual council of the splintered colonies of Númenor, and claimed he was directly descended from Berúthiel and therefore had not only a claim to the throne of Númenor, due to blood ties with the Golden One, but also the throne of Gondor. Few believed his claim at first, but he produced documents and an ancient ring that proved his bloodline, and showed the same skill with cats that Berúthiel was said to have. He then announced that if we would grant him the throne, he would lead us to great glory in the north, and we would have Middle-earth under our dominion and we would form a New Númenor. Although some resisted, most joined him, and so we assembled a mighty host and set sail north.

Now, we have arrived, on the shores of the lands of the Faithful, and we stand to await your order, my King. None know of our coming, and so we can act as we wish to; four chief foes await us. The Elves are pawns of the Valar and will resist us at all costs, and likewise the Dwarves, caring only for their greed, will seek to deny us tribute so both must be crushed under our heel. The Great Betrayer also skulks in the Land of Shadow, Mordor, and so he must be brought to justice before the throne for his crimes of high-treason against the Golden One. Finally, the ruling houses of Gondor and Dol Amroth, must be extinguished and their lands subjugated, and any who claims throne of the Faithful must be made to pay with their blood for their hearsay, for there is only one true heir, and that is you. I am also pleased to say the Kingdom of Arnor lies in ruins and cannot threaten you as its foe, the Witch-king, destroyed it long ago. How you deal with them is up to you, you can ally with one against the others, or simply crush them all in one fell blow.

Finally, I am pleased to inform you that you will be able to recruit any troops from any Human nation to our banner for our officers are well experienced in commanding men of different nations. Furthermore, the seed of discontent still lies ripe in the hearts of many in Gondor and with gentle persuasion and proof of our power many there will join with us. May I suggest we begin our conquest at Umbar, for the conquest of the great Númenórean port would prove to be a symbol of our might, and recently, a Gondor army led by a man named Thorongil sacked the city, and now only rebels of Gondor and Harad roam it, and it will be an easy conquest. It is now the Return of the True King! ]] UMBAR_START_TITLE = [[Return of the Ar-Adûnâim ]]

You need only march them to victory.\n\n\n\n[This is the end of the 'Barracks Event'. You can now train all of your forces... and so can the enemy: good luck!] ]]

GAMENOTES_BODY = [[I come to report on the readiness of our troops to support your plans. The state of the world has changed rapidly in only a few years and our production facilities have not kept up with your vision. We simply do not have the means to outfit our elite troops in any great numbers. I would expect it to take around 16 years until our production can support the mass fielding of high quality troops.\n\nYou must take to the field with whatever militia and medium tier troops you can muster. We will bring you word when our war machine is ready.\n\n\n\n[This message is describing the 'Barracks Event'. You will be unable to recruit elite units or build top tier unit production buildings until 64-68 turns have been played. THIS IS NOT A BUG.] ]]

WELCOMEDAC_BODY = [[Welcome to Divide and Conquer V5 - "A Kingdom United". This message is designed to brief you on the major changes between Divide and Conquer and vanilla Medieval II Total War. I would ask you take a few moments to read through this as it will answer 80% of all the questions we get asked!\n\n- Clicking the missions button will now also display a faction overview message that outlines the key features and limitations of the faction you are playing as\n\n- You will need Town Halls or Castle Halls in order to train units or agents in settlements.\n\n- Characters CANNOT die of old age- when they reach 127, their age resets to 0.\n\n- Many units get a visual change to their battle model when they are upgraded at a blacksmith.\n\n- Bodyguard units have a hard-coded replenishment number of 77 (on huge unit scale). If a unit starts with more than 77 (Thranduil for example) then he will not replenish until his number goes below 77 and then it will only return to 77. The number for Unique cavalry bodyguards is lower but suffers from the same mechanic.\n\n- There are no assassins but there are merchants, diplomats and spies. Diplomats are recruited from unique buildings dotted around the map.\n\n- Some factions have restricted town or castle development. The levels that are available are as follows:\nVillage, Town, Large Town, City and Large City;\nKeep, Castle and Stronghold.\nAnduin, Enedwaith and Dunland unlock Cities, Large Cities and Strongholds through their respective scripts. Bree can only get Large Cities if you make a certain choice. Harad also must unlock Large Cities and Strongholds through their Unite the Clans script.\n\n- Very few factions can build boats. Most factions have to rely on mercenary cogs.\n\n- When a faction goes below, on average, 3 settlements then a stack of 15-20 units will spawn to stand as the last stand of that faction. The stack will spawn only once and can be quite a challenge.\n\n- Rebel Generals and roaming armies under the control of the Independent Realms will now attack you immediately.\n\n- By pressing the 'SCRL LOCK' (Scroll Lock) button, you can turn off all UI in a single click; perfect for catching those triumphant moments!\n\n- There are some custom models on the campaign map that have a fort hidden under them but the model is part of a nearby settlement (e.g. Henneth Annun is part of Cair Andros). That said, if the main settlement is out of your camera's view, the custom model will disappear and you'll see the fort model - this is intentional and not a bug. ]]

Standing long against the Shadow of Mordor, they boast elite and powerful infantry, and diverse collection of troops that are recruited from their fiefdoms. Nevertheless, Gondor is also in decline and some fear the nation will not be able to stand against Mordor for much longer.\n\nCulture: Dunedain\nDuring the twilight of Numenor, the nation split into two factions, the Faithful and the Kingsmen. The Faithful fled the island nation on seven ships and founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-Earth. Since then, they are largely acted as a bulwark against the Shadow, defending the West from the Enemy. Descended from Lost Numenor, the Dunedain nations are some of the most advanced mortal kingdoms among Middle-Earth.\n\nSpecial Features:\nSettlement Restoration:\nGondor is able to reconstruct Western Osgiliath, Eastern Osgiliath and Fornost Erain.\nMadness of Denethor:\nDenethor throughout the campaign engages in a contest of will with Sauron through Gondor’s Palantir. His mind will be weakened and turn to madness if key Gondorian cities are lost or his sons perish in battle, resulting in global debuffs for Gondor. Destroying Mordor, regardless of if it’s through conquest or destroying the One Ring will end this script.\nFiefdom Recruitment:\nAlthough Gondor’s Fiefdom units are normally AoR, they can recruit a limited number of them by constructing a Fiefdom Barracks in Minas Tirith.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nGondor has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. Gondor has regular access to Level 1-5 armour from blacksmiths.\n\nThe Ring Script:\nAs one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Gondor can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples.\n\nEOPEDU units:\nFountain Shieldguard- Minas Tirith ]]

FACTION_INFO_ROHAN_BODY = [[Rohan, the Realm of the Horselords lies between Gondor and Mirkwood, standing strong as Gondor’s closest friend and ally during these troubled times. And yet, internal discontent threatens to erode this bond, as Théoden languishes in Edoras, and foul rumours swirl around the court. And yet, if he recovers, Rohan will be in a position of strength to face the twin foes of Dunland and Isengard, with a wealthy economy, capable mounted forces and strong allies.\n\nCulture: Northmen\nLong ago, there was a Northmen kingdom in Rhovanion during the early Third Age. However, it was shattered during the invasions of the Wainriders and its people splintered. While some remained and went on to found the nation of Dale, others fled to the Vales of the Anduin under Marhwini son of Marhari and became the Éothéod. And it was a migration of the Éothéod to the south, where they were gifted lands by Gondor in exchange for their friendship and aid at the Battle of the Field of Celebrant that saw them become the Rohirrim. Although there may be great geographic distances between these kingdoms, they can all lay claim to the common heritage of Northmen.\n\nSpecial Features:\nThéoden’s Fatigue:\nEnsorcelled by the words of Grima Wormtongue, Théoden begins the game locked in Edoras and can barely move. However, this is not permanent and he will be unlocked at Turn 10.\nGlittering Caves:\nIf Rohan holds Helm’s Deep and is allied to either the Dwarves of Ered Luin or Erebor for 20 Turns, they will be able to construct a Dwarven Outpost in the caves, granting them access to the powerful Dwarven Guard of the Caves unit.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nRohan has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers.

FACTION_INFO_BREE_BODY = [[Nestled in the heartlands of Eriador, Bree starts in a very well protected position. Natural defences dot the landscape, such as hills, rivers, and woodland. Bree do not have a formal military and they have very few units compared to most nations. Their only real strength comes in the assistance provided by the Dúnedain but they are restricted to only a few regions. In truth, Bree's military strategy is a defensive one, preferring holding units over attacking units and favouring infantry over cavalry.\n\nCulture: Middlemen\nThe Middlemen of Eriador and Enedwaith are descended from the native inhabitants of Middle-Earth prior to the Numenorean conquests. Labelled thus by Numenor and divided into the more peaceful costal Middlemen of Bree and Enedwaith and the militaristic highland peoples of Dunland and Rhuadaur, they have endured much on account of the Men of Westernesse, and yet despite Numenor’s sins, there are those who dwell peacefully among its descendants in Arnor and Gondor. And there are those who are ready to rise against the Faithful Kingdoms once more. Although they may lack the technology of other nations, they are capable men like any other and are ready to make their own choices and defend their homes.\n\nSpecial Features:\nUnconventional Recruitment:\nUnlike the vast majority of factions in the game, Bree lacks a formal military and the infrastructure to support and recruit it. Instead, they recruit units from their economic buildings, such as farms and roads, among others.\nBree’s Choice:\nAround fifteen years into the game (sixty turns), Bree will be faced with either forsaking or becoming closer with the Dúnedain. Forsaking them allows Bree access to powerful buildings that allow the recruitment of every mercenary in the game, the ability to recruit certain dwarf units and artillery, and large cities, although you will lose access to Dúnedain units, and all existing units will leave your faction. Seeking closer bonds with the Dúnedain allows Bree to recruit more Dúnedain units, build highways, rebuild the Bridge of Tharbad and a higher tier blacksmith that provides an additional tier of armour, that also grants Greenway, Watchguard and the Gatekeepers Arnorian themed visual upgrades.\nHobbit Allies:\nBree can recruit Bandobras Archers and Watch Shirriffs from Smials in Hobbit regions.\nThe Barrow Downs:\nIf Bree holds Mengalen, the Barrow Wights in the surrounding crypts will arise to terrorise the lands, seeking to drive those not sworn to Angmar from the lands. However, each Barrow Wight army defeated will bring greater security to the region and result in a population increase. Once Mengalen is upgraded to a town, the crypts can be restored if Bree remains allied to the the Northern Dúnedain, and securing the crypts allows Bree to muster Dúnedain Steelbowmen from the region as a result of uncovering and restoring these weapons from the crypts and the battlefields surrounding them.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nBree can build all settlement tiers bar large cities. To unlock large cities, they must forsake the Dúnedain and chose to hire mercenaries in their choice script. Bree has regular access to Level 1-3 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 4 armour from blacksmiths if they side with the Northern Dúnedain in their choice script.\n\nThe Ring Script:\nAs one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Bree can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples. ]]

FACTION_INFO_ND_BODY = [[The Northern Dúnedain are a shattered and broken people but are still possessed of a hardy and stalwart spirit. They are the watchers in the North, and the sentinels of Eriador, a duty that sees them face the savage forces of Moria, Goblintown and Gundabad while combating a renewed Angmar. While they may not have the most diverse roster of their own, their chieftain Aragorn and his heirs inspire the mortal men of Middle-Earth to fight for them.\n\nCulture: Dúnedain\nDuring the twilight of Numenor, the nation split into two factions, the Faithful and the Kingsmen. The Faithful fled the island nation on seven ships and founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-Earth. Since then, they are largely acted as a bulwark against the Shadow, defending the West from the Enemy. Descended from Lost Numenor, the Dunedain nations are some of the most advanced mortal kingdoms among Middle-Earth.\n\nSpecial Features:\nSettlement Restoration:\nThe Northern Dúnedain can reconstruct Western Osgiliath, Annúminas and Fornost Erain\nBeacon of Hope:\nAs the beacon of hope for mortal men, Aragorn and his heirs inspires even those from foreign nations to fight for them. The Northern Dúnedain can recruit the forces of allied Good non-Numenorean nations using the mercenary mechanic. Evil mortal and other Numenorean nations require the Northern Dúnedain’s barracks to be built in those regions to recruit forces from those nations. If the Reunited Kingdom formed, the Northern Dúnedain lose access to this mechanic.\nLocal Militia:\nRather than having their own militia, the Northern Dúnedain rally local mortal militia to their banner through their barracks.\nAragorn’s Quest:\nAs a destined scion of Elendil’s line, Aragorn will be faced with his own quest. By following the event prompts that begin at Turn 5, you can eventually unlock the Army of the Dead, a nigh invincible army that will fight three battles for Aragorn before their oath is fulfilled and they are released. Aragorn’s quest will also allow him to decide between forming the Reunited Kingdom or reforging Arnor.\nThe Reunited Kingdom:\nBy declaring to form the Reunited Kingdom and completing Aragorn’s quest, the Northern Dúnedain will merge with Gondor and Dol Amroth (So long as you are allied to Gondor and Dol Amroth, and Gondor holds Minas Tirith) and Eastern Osgiliath will be rebuilt. While the Beacon of Hope mechanic will be removed due to the fear of the Reunited Kingdom by some as another imperialist power, you will unlock the Ancillary Barracks, a new building line that allows recruitment of powerful mortal units from other nations if you build it in their regions. You can also recruit Gondorian and Dol Amroth troops by building your barracks in their regions and gain access to Level 6 armour.\nArnor Reforged:\nBy either declaring to reforge Arnor as part of Aragorn’s quest, or by Aragorn himself dying before the Reunited Kingdom is formed, the Northern Dúnedain will be placed on the path to reforge Arnor. Once the House of Kings in Annúminas is rebuilt, so long as you are allied to Bree and Bree holds Bree itself, Arnor will be reforged. The Northern Dúnedain will merge with Bree and retain access to the Beacon of Hope mechanic. Furthermore, you will be able to recruit certain Bree units as follows: Greenway units from roads in regions where the Greenway ran historically, Gatekeepers from the Prancing Pony in Bree, and Watchmen units from your barracks in Bree regions. All Bree units also feature Arnorian visual upgrades. Reforming Arnor will also you to train the powerful Sworn Infantry and Horsemen from your barracks as your newfound resources allow you to outfit the local militia who flock to your banner with more elite equipment. You also unlock Level 5 armour.\nArnorian Troops:\nBy forming either the Reunited Kingdom or Arnor, you will unlock powerful Arnorian AoR troops (From their Arnorian homelands) and the Sons of Numenor (From either Minas Tirith or Annúminas). Defeating Angmar will also allow the recruitment of Rhuadaur troops once either nation is formed.\nHobbit Allies:\nThe Northern Dúnedain can recruit Bandobras Archers and Watch Shirriffs from Smials in Hobbit regions.\nGandalf:\nOnce a certain milestone in Aragorn’s quest is reached (Or Aragorn himself has perished), the Grey Wizard Gandalf will rally to aid the Northern Dúnedain once you have reached Turn 40. Furthermore, if Gandalf perishes, he may return as Gandalf the White.\nThe Barrow Downs:\nIf the Northern Dúnedain holds Mengalen, the Barrow Wights in the surrounding crypts will arise to terrorise the lands, seeking to drive those not sworn to Angmar from the lands. However, each Barrow Wight army defeated will bring greater security to the region and result in a population increase. Once Mengalen is upgraded to a town, the crypts can be restored, and securing the crypts allows the Northern Dúnedain to muster Dúnedain Steelbowmen from the region as a result of uncovering and restoring these weapons from the crypts and the battlefields surrounding them.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nAs a result of their scattered and disparate nature, the Northern Dúnedain must either form the Reunited Kingdom or reforge Arnor to unlock Cities, Large Cities and Strongholds. The Northern Dúnedain have regular access to Level 1-4 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 5 armour from blacksmiths if they reform Arnor, and can gain Level 5-6 armour if they form the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nThe Ring Script:\nAs one of the nations of the Free Peoples, the Northern Dúnedain can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in, and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can chose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples. ]]

A proud kingdom, recently re-established by Bard after the Battle of the Five Armies and the death of Smaug, they can count upon many firm allies, such as Erebor, the Woodland Realm and Dorwinion to make up for their poor financial conditions at the beginning of the game. Their own forces are also capable, with fine infantry and deadly archers. Dale stands as the bastion of mortal men in Rhovanion and is ready to combat the forces of Gundabad, Dol Guldur and the Confederation of Rhûn.\n\nCulture: Northmen\nLong ago, there was a Northmen kingdom in Rhovanion during the early Third Age.

Although there may be great geographic distances between these kingdoms, they can all lay claim to the common heritage of Northmen.\n\nSpecial Features:\nSplit Barracks System:\nAs the Vale of the Anduin, you must choose which people you dedicate a region to, where it be the Woodsmen skilled in archery, the capable infantry of the Beornings or the deadly cavalry of the Éothéod by building their barracks there. Building such a barracks prevents the recruitment of the other two peoples in that region but allows you access to the powerful troops of the people you selected. This choice is per region.\nThe Mountain Passes:\nTo unlock their building restrictions, the Vale of the Anduin must hold open the passes of the Misty Mountains and build a series of powerful fortifications to ensure travel is not restricted and there can be economic prosperity.

And the nation is faced with another choice- will it dedicate itself to fully enlisting the immortal Avari elves in its military or rely on its mortal men?

Dorwinion must then chose whether they will be enlisted as troops or whether they will aid as smiths and craftsmen. Allowing the Avari to serve as soldiers will grant you access to their elites as your late game roster, although they have long replenishment, and allow you to upgrade your units with Avari armour. Dedicating them to the economy however will mean your late game roster will be made up of mortal men, less capable than the Avari but with a faster replenishment. This choice is global, and the units are mutually exclusive- you must choose between your late game elites being either the Avari or men. However, a small army of the side you didn’t select will spawn for you several turns after you have made the choice to aid your cause. You will be able to retrain this force through either the Windan Palace for the Avari, or the Avari Academy for the Northmen contingent.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nDorwinion has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers.

The chief lesson that the Dwarves of Erebor have taken from the desolation of Smaug is that the best defence is a good offence. Favouring manoeuvrability over defence, they have the deadliest of all Dwarven charges and their skill with their weapons is unmatched. Further still, the army of Erebor fields no archers or crossbows and instead favours the lethal Dwarven throwing axe. Allies from the Orocarni do still fight at range and a wise commander adopts both Erebor's offensive stance with support from the more defensive Orocarni.\n\nCulture: Dwarven\nDwarves are the sons and daughters of Aulë and are among the hardiest of the inhabitants of Middle-Earth. Strong and stout, what they lack in height, they more than make up for in their crafting and mining skills, and their ferocity is unmatched in warfare. While like anyone, they are prone to vices and flaws, they were shaped by Aulë to be especially resistant to sorcerous domination and the magical corruption of Morgoth and his ilk. However, of all peoples, they are also the most prone to immense greed. Nevertheless, they are fierce, and strong people who make good allies and a terrible foe.\n\nSpecial Features:\nGrudges:\nIf the ancestral Dwarven homes are not controlled by any of the Dwarven kingdoms, their leaders will suffer penaltys until those settlements are under Dwarven control. The settlements are Erebor, Dain's Halls, Gundabad, and Khazad-Dûm.

War has not been seen in Ered Luin since the First Age and very few dwarves there have ever seen battle. They are however excellent creators and through centuries of tinkering and practice they have perfected the crossbow. As a point of pride, despite the lack of threats, they have always ensured that all dwarves train and use their mighty crossbows. So, whilst their melee forces may fall behind the other Dwarven nations, their ranged divisions will always be fearsome.\n\nCulture: Dwarven\nDwarves are the sons and daughters of Aulë and are among the hardiest of the inhabitants of Middle-Earth. Strong and stout, what they lack in height, they more than make up for in their crafting and mining skills, and their ferocity is unmatched in warfare. While like anyone, they are prone to vices and flaws, they were shaped by Aulë to be especially resistant to sorcerous domination and the magical corruption of Morgoth and his ilk. However, of all peoples, they are also the most prone to immense greed. Nevertheless, they are fierce, and strong people who make good allies and a terrible foe.\n\nSpecial Features:\nThe Dwarven Rings:\nSometime into the game, you will be given a choice to accept the three Dwarven rings in return for neutrality with the world. If you reject the rings, you will unlock a unique tier of port and gain access to an elven unit, King's Mounted Hammerguard, Mithril Guard (restricted to Thorin’s Hall, Fahamgathol and Khazad Dum) and the campaign will play out normally. If you accept the rings, you will instantly become neutral with everyone and unlock the Grimborn Reavers and Azog Defilers. Some turns later, you will be attacked by the High Elves or the Dúnedain. If you survive, you will then be attacked by Erebor and Khazad-dûm unless you forge an alliance with them (the ones you ally won't attack you). If you survive, then the quest ends and you must reap the consequences of your actions.\nBuzra-Dûm Reclamation:\nShould you reclaim Buzra-Dûm from the foul orcs that have settled there, you may uncover the vaults to access vast wealth. Uncovering all of the ruins will grant access to equipment allowing you to recruit Beleriand Honour Guard, though be prepared as great evil is rumoured to sleep beneath the ruins. The other dwarven nations may be persuaded to send assistance you remain allied with them, and diplomats are dispatched to seek aid.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nEred-Luin has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. Ered Luin has regular access to Level 1-6 armour from blacksmiths, and can gain Level 7 armour from blacksmiths built in regions with the mithril resource.\n\nThe Ring Script:\nAs one of the nations of the Free Peoples, Ered-Luin can either destroy the One Ring by capturing the settlement the One Ring has been found in and sending the general with it to the Imladris to undertake this process by seeking the White Council, or they can choose to keep the ring for themselves and forsake the Free Peoples. ]]

They craft mighty shields that they train with endlessly until the shield becomes an extension of their arm. They also wear the finest Dwarven armour in Middle-Earth and seek finer yet in the hopes of garbing themselves in mithril once they’ve reclaimed the city. This reliance on defence and armour does slow them down on the battlefield, however. To compensate for this, they field nimble archers to harass their enemies as the slow-moving column of Dwarven fury makes its way to the battlelines! However, will this martial might be enough to change the course of history?

Meanwhile, Lindon and the Grey Havens in the west are far from your foes, and appear safe for the moment, and are sure to play a key role in your economy. Centuries of brutal warfare against the shadow has made the remaining few Noldor the finest warriors on the face of Arda. Boasting Middle-earths’ best cavalry, infantry, and archers, it is hard to see how any nation will hold back the High Elves. Unfortunately, the same conditions that have bred this excellent class of warrior have also caused the decline of their population and Imladris and Lindon cannot field large armies at any time, as troops either perish or leave into the West. Nevertheless, Elrond and Cirdan will see the Enemy defeated, and the Dark Tower thrown down!\n\nCulture: Elven\nElves are the firstborn and are among the eldest of the races still in Middle-Earth.

Higher tier units also require the Jewel Guild to be rebuilt (such as Moon Guard, Storm Guard, Elderinwe units) \nReturned Allies: \nAt turn 15 you will need to move a diplomat to Ost Sûl.

The clans rely heavily on ambush and guerrilla warfare: being neither the most numerous nor the strongest of people in Middle-earth. Their poor technological state and dis-unified nation leaves them outmatched by almost all other forces initially. The free folk of Enedwaith do have one strength: their javelins. No other nation fields such deadly javelin throwers and even the walking immortals known as Eregion Smiths will fall like flowers before the hail of Enedwaith javelins.\n\nCulture: Middlemen\nThe Middlemen of Eriador and Enedwaith are descended from the native inhabitants of Middle-Earth prior to the Numenorean conquests. Labelled thus by Numenor and divided into the more peaceful costal Middlemen of Bree and Enedwaith and the militaristic highland peoples of Dunland and Rhuadaur, they have endured much on account of the Men of Westernesse, and yet despite Numenor’s sins, there are those who dwell peacefully among its descendants in Arnor and Gondor. And there are those who are ready to rise against the Faithful Kingdoms once more. Although they may lack the technology of other nations, they are capable men like any other and are ready to make their own choices and defend their homes.\n\nSpecial Features:\nUnconventional Recruitment:\nAt the start of the game, Enedwaith lacks a conventional military and infrastructure.

Additionally, Tharbad must be occupied and the Tir Crocoil constructed in it to reforge the nation. Reclaiming regions with Clanseats will also provide you with more powerful troops and allies from those clans, and conquering Dunland will allow you to recruit Dunlending troops from those regions.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nEnedwaith cannot build cities/large cities/strongholds at the beginning of the game due to their inferior technological status and the fracutured and ununified nature of their nation. Unifying Enedwaith and reforging the Confederation of Athámor by rebuilding the Tir Crocoil will unlock these tiers.

And there are those who are ready to rise against the Faithful Kingdoms once more. Although they may lack the technology of other nations, they are capable men like any other and are ready to make their own choices and defend their homes.\n\nSpecial Features:\nSplit Barracks System:\nAs Dunland, you must choose which people you dedicate a region to, where it be the mounted troops of the Frekkalingir or the hard-hitting ranged forces of the Dunhird by building their barracks there. Building such a barracks prevents the recruitment of the force you don’t select in that region but allows you access to the powerful troops of the people you selected. You are able to train your Dunlending and King’s Warband units regardless of the choice you make. This choice is per region.\nDunlending Allies:\nConstructing Dunhird barracks in Enedwaith regions allows the recruitment of certain Enedwaith units and constructing Frekkalingir barracks in Rohan regions allows the recruitment of certain Rohirric units.\nThe Vengeance Pact:\nDunland has sworn to enact vengeance against is foe of Rohan, and to reclaim the Kingship of Calenardhon in the name of Wulf’s Line, and Saruman has promised them aid. By holding 8 Regions by Turn 80, Dunland will prove itself to Isengard and receive the ability to train Orthanc Guard and Wardens from your capital landmark buildings (High Brenin’s Roost and Wulf’s Hall in Edoras once it is constructed). Conquering Helm’s Deep will then allow Dunland to train Wulfguard units from special landmarks across the map and allow them access to advance blacksmith functionality and special visual upgrades for the Wulfguard units. Taking Edoras and constructing Wulf’s Hall on top of Meduseld will unlock the Heralds of the Twofold King and Dunland’s building restrictions\nDunnish Superiority:\nIf you fail to hold 8 regions by Turn 80 or backstab Isengard, Saruman will abandon you and will unleash an Uruk tide out of the gates of Isengard to crush Dunland and Rohan alike. You can continue the script but are tasked with capturing Isengard instead of Helm’s Deep (which unlocks the recruitment of Wulfguard units from landmarks, advance blacksmith functionality and their visual upgrade) and will then be tasked with reclaiming Edoras as normal. You will be unable to recruit Orthanc Guard and Wardens from your capital landmarks but can still recruit some from Isengard. There are no unique rewards from this route.\nGeneral Spawns:\nHolding 5, 7 and 8 regions will spawn custom generals under your command.

To unlock them, they must complete their script by reclaiming the Kingship of Calenardhon and constructing Wulf’s Hall in Edoras.

Although there may be great geographic distances between these kingdoms, they can all lay claim to the common heritage of Northmen.\n\nSpecial Features:\nDorwinion’s Choice:\nBy reclaiming Mornedhel the remainder of Dorwinion’s Avari allies will be convinced to aid the realm militarily. Dorwinion must then chose whether they will be enlisted as troops or whether they will aid as smiths and craftsmen. Allowing the Avari to serve as soldiers will grant you access to their elites as your late game roster, although they have long replenishment, and allow you to upgrade your units with Avari armour. Dedicating them to the economy however will mean your late game roster will be made up of mortal men, less capable than the Avari but with a faster replenishment. This choice is global, and the units are mutually exclusive- you must choose between your late game elites being either the Avari or men. However, a small army of the side you didn’t select will spawn for you several turns after you have made the choice to aid your cause. You will be able to retrain this force through either the Windan Palace for the Avari, or the Avari Academy for the Northmen contingent.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nDorwinion has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers. Dorwinion also has regular access to Level 1-4 armour from blacksmiths, and Level 5 armour from blacksmiths if they choose Avari units in their choice script. ]]

Favouring manoeuvrability over defence, they have the deadliest of all Dwarven charges and their skill with their weapons is unmatched.

The harsh conditions of the frozen tundra have shaped them into fierce warriors and keen-sighted archers, and this fighting skill makes up for their lack of numbers. Their frozen isolated stronghold also offers them the perfect position to strike at either the Vale of the Anduin or the Dwarves of Erebor, supported by their troll allies. Furthermore, these orcs who consider themselves the chosen of Melkor have even grander ambitions, as they are determined to subjugate all of Middle-Earth.\n\nCulture: Shadow of Melkor\nFollowers of the Shadow of Melkor are those who claim fealty to the Dark Powers themselves, as represented in Middle-Earth by Sauron himself. While most are orcs, having been first shaped by Melkor, some men such as the Angmarim also pay homage to these dark powers. Those who follow the Shadow of Melkor can join in invasions but also must answer to Sauron himself.\n\nSpecial Features:\nScavengers:\nIn historical Dwarven mansions, Gundabad can construct Avenger’s Guilds, which allow the recruitment of Orc Avengers, and also provide both melee weapon and armour upgrades to your units. These regions include Khazad-dûm West and East, Erebor, Kirikhgathol, Dain’s Halls, Fahamgathol, Thorin’s Halls and Buzra-dûm. Long occupied by the orcs, there is little left to scavenge in Gundabad itself.\nOrcish Subjugation:\nAs the self-proclaimed Chosen of Melkor, the snow orcs of Gundabad seek to subjugate Middle-Earth and their rivals. By conquering the capitals of certain evil nations, they unlock the ability to train troops from those nations from those capitals. These nations include Angmar, Moria, Isengard, Dol Guldur and Mordor.\n\nBuilding Limitations:\nGundabad has no building limitations and has full access to all settlement tiers.

It will not be simple- Denethor is not the Steward his father was, and the people have grown distrustful and afraid. It will not be a simple matter of walking into Minas Tirith and claiming the Kingship I am afraid.

Do not expect to assume the Kingship without diplomatic overtures- to most you are an outsider. Ensure that both Dol Amroth and Gondor count you as an ally.

Now you are ready but now, there is more to the world than there was all those years ago."\n\nElrond took a step away from the heat and sat by the entrance to the forge, there he gazed into the skies and was troubled. At length, he spoke again: "The old kingdoms of north and south are not as they once were. There are foes far more fierce than there were in your youth- I speak of the strength of Angmar renewed under Agandaûr and the threefold threat of Moria, Goblintown and Gundabad. They move to crush the free peoples of Eriador. There are those who call for the restoration of Arnor to combat these threats, and who do not wish to see you travel south to Gondor to assume the High Kingship. The people do not want Gondor's burdens, and wish to remain autonomous from the south. They fear you will abandon them, never to return, leaving them at the mercy of Angmar and the goblins of the mountains. You must make this tough and hard decision- whether to take the Kingship of Arnor and leave Gondor to whatever fate may befall it or stand as the King of the Reunited Kingdom - despite the concerns of Eriador. Also note that there are many who also follow you now because they see in you a Beacon of Hope- if you reunite Gondor and Arnor, they may instead see you another conquerer. They will be more hesitant to join you and rather than flocking to your banner, you may have to convince them and train them yourself."\n\n"Neither choice is easy but none bar you can make it. While you may continue with your quest either way, to reforge Arnor, you must rebuild the House of Kings in Annuminas, whereas assuming the kingship of the Reunited Kingdom will require you to complete your quest and travel to Minas Tirith itself. Now is the time to decide..."\n\n\n PRESS ACCEPT TO EMBARK UPON THE REUNITED KINGDOM ROUTE, DECLINE TO REJECT THE REUNITED KINGDOM AND RESOLVE TO REFORGE ARNOR ]]

With its might restored, we can reform the battalions of Arnor anew, training Cardolan and Arthedain units once more.

To that end, in 2970 T.A Elrond sent the Lords Elladan and Elrohir to the Dúnedain.

Now all the High Elves of the West call you a usurper and consider you an enemy. Their lords won't allow the scion of a treacherous and cursed house to become High King of the Ñoldor.

The House of Feanor survived, became independent as Realm of Eregion in the Second Age and as Realm of Hirneryn in the Third Age thanks to Maernil who gathered and led westwards remnants of the Ñoldor of Eregion and also saved all the sacred knowledge of Gwaith-i-Mírdain. Long time has passed since Gil-Galad's fall, and no one had claimed his throne except Maernil. He might have become a good king of all the Ñoldor, if other elven lords endorsed his candidacy. But they didn't. Most of the elves wanted Elrond to become a new king, but neither had he accepted it, nor he supported Maernil's right. Elrond is still the most popular and influential chief of the Eldar, he is a leader of White Council and has many allies among free peoples of Middle-Earth, including elves of Lorien and Mirkwood, Dwarves and Men of Eriador. But probably things will change in the end of the Third Age, and we will finally restore a former glory...\n\nBecause of the small number of the Ñoldor, our best units can be recruited only in a few provinces. But in time when our tiny realm expands into a great kingdom many elves may want to join us. When the time comes (you control 17 provinces and 60 turns made) you will be given a chance to claim to the throne of High King of the Ñoldor. Your campaign can be proceeded as follow: \n\n1) You need to capture West Moria as soon as possble. \n\n2) You need to control another 17 settlements and number of turns >60. \n\n3)Take control of Mithlond and Rivendell, eliminate Elrond and other lords of High Elves (destroy this faction). \n\nThis is the only way to gain an absolute power over the Eldar and get full roster of High-Elven units. ]]

DORWINION_CHOICE_BODY = [[Dorwinion is a warm and fertile land and is known for its unmatched wines, long summers and peaceful existence. However, to the locals, Dorwinion is known as a land of two cultures: the Northmen, kindred of the Dalesmen and Rohirrim and; the long-lost Avari. The Avari are a group of Elves who opted to not make the Great Journey with Oromë at the awakening and instead settled in the east of Middle-earth. They shunned their own kin and claimed Windan Forest as their home. There, at the base of Mount Kinn-lai they built a grand city to rival even Nargothrond - Mornedhel. In their hidden city they dwelt for thousands of years, unheeded by the world, in peace. \n\nHowever, in the mid Third Age, long before the memory of any living Northman, the ancient capital of the Avari was sacked by an overwhelming force of Easterlings in one of Middle-earth's most devestating battles. Many Avari lives were lost but a great many Elves managed to flee to Dorwinion where they were welcomed and found shelter. Filled with sadness and grief for the loss of Mornedhel, a great host of Avari soon deperated Dorwinion and headed northeast: disappearing from the pages of history. \n\nOnly the remnant Avari, those who stayed in Dorwinion, know where their kin now reside and they keep this a closely guarded secret. For the remnant, life has been peaceful and good and they have integrated more and more into Human society, even allowing the Vine-Regent to sit on the Avarin Remnant Council! There is still an unquiet in the Avari however as they live so close to their ancestral home but cannot reclaim it. Nurwë often attempts to convince the Vintner Court to reclaim the city as he belives that should the banners of Dorwinion fly above the parapets of Mornedhel then the Avari will return again and Dorwinion will rise anew in glory. ]]

Is it true, has Mornedhel finally been freed?" the Vine-Regent replied: "It is true. The battalions of the Thorn have fought hard, and well, and the city has been liberated. Not only that, we would now offer it back to you, freely given, in payment for what your people - the Remnant - have done to help Dorwinion flourish. It is the least we can do. We would see the Avari return to this land in a glorious homecoming!" the messenger wavered, overcome with emotion. He gathered himself: "My Lord, you do us the greatest of honours. We surely cannot repay such a magnanimous gift! My people will readily accept this offer and we will return to Dorwinion. I speak for the Triumvirate when I say we will repay this gift tenfold. Our people are hardy and strong, and able to serve as you see fit Vine-Regent."\n\nYou must now decide how the Avari will serve Dorwinion. Do you want them to take up arms and provide battalions of elite Elven forces - made up of excellent archers and defenders, albeit few in number? Alternatively, the Elves can be put to work for the economic benefit of Dorwinion - their assistance will see our coffers fill with coin and free up the Northmen to take up arms themselves which would provide Dorwinion with many more battalions of newly outfitted Northmen warriors.\n\n\n[Click on the tick to gain access to slower trained and few but elite Avari troops, click on the cross to gain access to faster trained and more numerous but mid-tier Human troops] ]]

BREE_INFLUENCE_CHOICE_BODY = [[M'lord, the nature of our talks became known to the Dúnedain and they sent a lordly messenger of their own, Pedhaer, to assist with the process. Now, after a full year of discussion, arguments, bitterness and no small amount of peacekeeping it is clear we have a choice of two paths to walk:\n\nThe first is perhaps the more feared yet most eloquently, yet pleadingly, requested by Pedhaer and that is to stand with the Dúnedain; shoulder to shoulder. He asked that we rise up and declare boldly and unabashedly that we, the Bree-landers and simple Hobbits of the Shire, will not stand for Sauron's dominion! He asked that we not see the blood of the Dúnedain, Elves and Dwarves be disrespected with our ignorance and willful neglect of our own defence and that we fight for the freedom of Middle-earth. The council was at first horrified by his scornful words and the idea of marching to far corners of the world but some felt it was our duty to assist those who have defended us, unseen, for countless years. Pedhaer's suggestion was that we directly help fund the Dúnedain war effort; although this will mean a big monetary hit to our own coffers. However he said that much of that money would combine with our well developed infrastructure to ensure that our stout fighters would be equipped in the garb of Old Arnor! The White Tree would stand proud on the chests of every man who fights for our freedom. He also told of how the Dúnedain themselves would eagerly fight with us if we came out of, what he called, hiding and that together we would be nigh on unstoppable. Furthermore he spoke of a number of Elves of both Imladris and Lindon who would be so moved by our defiance that they too would stand with us against the shadow! Finally he recounted tales of the majesty of the Great Roads of Eriador and the mighty bridge at Tharbad and how we, with Dúnedain help, could rewrite those tales with great roads of our own! Pedhaer spoke of power, freedom, majesty and hope, but his talk of money didn't sit well with most and the Hobbits espeiclly sneer at him even now for fear that their sons, brothers and fathers will be sent to war. Not an easy path to walk but surely it is the morally right one? Do we leave the Free Peoples to stand alone, should their blood be spilled whilst we grow fat and lazy? Are we trully ready to spill our own blood though? How will the Council face the wives and mothers of those sent outside Eriador, how will we face the wives and mothers of those sent that do not return?\n\nThe second path was greatly lauded by many as the 'perfect solution'; we simply pay others to do what we 'should not have to do'. These words were spoken by Dringol; a most stout, block-headed, stubborn, rude, cowardly, miserly, old and bothersome Hobbit. He was the most outspoken opponent of Pedhaer and he propsed a simple solution. He cried that we should look to our own borders, our builders should not be out restoring weed-infested old roads but instead should be building better fortifications here for our people. He felt that strong walls and not strong arms would be needed to stop the tide of darkness. He argued for the importance of maintaining our thriving economy and to do this on our own, not by letting every 'Tom, Dick or Harry who happens upon the Bree-land to waltz in!' His plans had the support of many of the councilmen for the promise of wealth was very real and where Pedhaer speaks of an overall decline in our wealth, Dringol proclaims that it can be made tenfold what it already is. Finally, the isolationists would have us buy our protection from cuthroats and bandits rather than risk our own sons on the field. They talk of how many travellers pass through the Bree-land asking for work and that we should put them to use defending our interests abroad. Under Dringol's plan mercenaries from the farthest reaches of Middle-earth would come to fight under our banner and our people will be safe. He even talks of Dwarven warriors from both Ered Luin and Khazad-dûm who have expressed an interest in fighting for us if the price is right! This path seems cowardly to me but the promise of safety, wealth, grand cities and others to do our dieing seems almost too good to be true; doesn't it?\n\nAfter all this time a decision has to be made.

Rumours have reached us from the East, coming on trade caravans, and spread across one clan to another through riders, speaking of great chaos and battles.\n\nDue to the many sources of these tales, their contents are contradictory. Some speak of a great host of Dwarves that have descended from the Orocarni to pillage and devastate the Clans; others speak of clans that, once sane, have become mad overnight, turning away from the Dark Lord and forsaking their lands to wage war on their friends or flee from the lands devoted to the Dark Tower.\n\nMost rumours speak, however, of two figures clad in blue that walk the plains, leaving naught but chaos in their wake. Some riders claim these are only servants of the Dark Tower that have been dispatched by the Dark Lord to test us, and if we yield to their offers we shall be struck down by the Dark Lord and our clan and its memory shall be purged and cast into oblivion.\n\nI, however, read in my youth of the Istari, an order of beings akin to the Dark Lord that serve the treacherous Valar and seek to cast our Lord into the abyss. I fear they may be of this order and their aim is to seduce us away from the Dark Lord and deceive us into a war with the Dark Tower.\n\nI have spoken to many riders and the rumours have been moving west, towards us, with the speed of our finest horses.

I fear we must make ourselves ready to receive them as we cannot fight them with such short notice.\n\nTaking your throne, you made ready to entertain the Blue Wizards. After a few minutes the two Istari swept into your tent, clad in robes of sky blue and clutching simple staffs carved of the dark wood of the plains, the two bowed to you and began to address you. "Oh Great Khan, leader of the diverse and mighty people of Khand, and your retinue; we are the Blue Wizards, I am Alatar and my companion is Pallando. We have come to you to ask of you a harrowing task, one that will be the most difficult that you have ever faced but in its undertaking your people shall become more prosperous and your memory shall be enshrined in your legends for ages to come. We ask for you to abandon Sauron and join us." \n\nAt the mention of the Dark Lord's name some of your retinue jeered at the heretical act the Istari had committed, others spat at the Istari due to their sheer absurdity of their request. Pallando continued, undeterred by the jeering, "We know this goes against all of your traditions and your beliefs, but you serve a lord who treats you as mere pieces upon the board, willing to throw away as many lives as it takes, without consideration... as long as he accomplishes his goals. Furthermore, he values you even less than he does his other servants - for you are divided and scattered and in his eyes you are nothing compared to the unified hammers of Harad and Rhun; it is those two that shall be rewarded if Sauron claims dominion over Middle-earth. Your clan shall only be tossed scraps. \n\nIf you desert him, you can forge a new golden age for Khand, one in which you will be beholden to no one. Furthermore not only shall we and our host join you, for you are our final destination as Khan, but the Orocarni shall serve you and they shall grant you the secrets of the crossbow. If you do align with us however, we fear we dwell too close to the Shadow of Mordor and Sauron will easily be able to send an Inquisitor to crush our rebellion, hence, we shall need to fight against foes from every side. We know this is a fateful decision for you, so we shall give you the night to think over it." The two Istari and your retinue left your tent, leaving you with your advisor.\n\nKhan, I can see now why many clans joined them. Their offer is compelling and does ring true. However, I think if we were to deny them, the Dark Lord may reward us; perhaps with the knowledge of taming the Great Beasts. The Inquisitor the Istari spoke of would be granted to us as a reward, along with the service of his troops. I think he may be a Black Numenorean, so perhaps we would be granted the service of Mordor's famed Temple Legions. With such rewards from the Dark Tower, we could prove that we are worth more than scraps and defy the destiny they foretold of us under the Dark Lord, our people would even find you a truly great leader. In the end however, it is your decision, my Khan.\n\nIf we wish to accept the offer of the Istari click the green tick, if we refuse click the red cross. ]]

He strode into your throne room and threw off his coat, revealing he was not a Nazgûl as many feared but a mere mortal; a Black Numenorean of the Temple, clad in the fine garments of the Temple and extruding an aura of fear, one that demanded respect. And yet for all his dignity and grandeur, he panted, almost as if he had not stopped to rest on his journey to your capital.\n\nHe cried out “Lord of this land, I have been sent by the Chief Inquisitor Ancantar, the Black Hand of Sauron, who holds complete power in matters that concern the Blue Wizards. They have turned Khand against us and seek to undermine the victories we have gained with their allies; treacherous Dwarves of the East. However, Ancantar requires assistance, hence, he requests that you aid him.”\n\nAfter agreeing to his request, for defeating Khand would aid in your security and safeguard your interests, he rushed out of the room and departed on his steed as quickly as he came; undoubtedly to return to his master. ]]

AMROTH_START_BODY = [[Welcome, My Lord, to Dor-en-Ernil, the Land of the Prince, more commonly known as Belfalas, consisting of all the land between the Rivers Gilrain in the east and the Ringló in the west. Although part of the realm of Gondor, the Land of the Prince is a semi-autonomous domain, ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth, the third most influential man in Gondor behind the Steward and his son. Such recognition is appropriate for one in whose veins flows the blood of Imrazôr the Númenórean and Mithrellas the Elf maiden. For twenty-one generations, from Imrazôr to Adrahil II, the Princes have supported the King and later the Steward in the defence and preservation of the realm.\n\nHigh above the city of Dol Amroth the Silver Swan and White Ship Banners of the city snap in the sea-breeze; raised high on the Tirith Aear, the residence of the Prince. The Tirith Aear or Sea-ward Tower also houses the standing army of the city; the Wardens of Tirith Aear. A well trained force that serves as the household guard of the Prince and his family. That said, the Prince can also rely on the soldiers of Tirith Aear to take to the field in times of war to bolster his armies. There are few cities in Middle-earth that can field such a well-equipped army as Dol Amroth. The blood of Númenor still runs strong in the people of the city and in none is this more evident than the famed Swan Knights. Their prowess on the battlefield is unmatched, to see their armour glinting in the sun, tall lances lowering for an unstoppable charge brings joy to even the most jaded ally and fear to the most stalwart foe. They are indeed the greatest of us all, yet the martial skills of all the soldiers of Dol Amroth are mighty indeed.\n\nAlthough Dol Amroth is the principal city of Belfalas, it is not the only settlement in our land that is worthy of note, the port of Edhellond is an ancient Elven Haven, which is now home to many who can claim the blood of the fair folk. When the Men of Númenor began settling the coast of Belfalas, some intermingled with the Elves of Edhellond and the people of Edhellond are descendants of such unions. Their contributions to the arts notwithstanding, the people of Edhellond have greatly enhanced the realm through the expertise of their mariners and shipwrights. Their contributions have resulted in our possessing one of the finest navies in the West.\n\nThe rest of the lands of Dor-en-Ernil are fertile, beautiful and well settled. For protection from sea raiders, the coastal villages rely on the stout-hearted coastal wardens who remain ever vigilant. During times of trouble the garrison of Dol Amroth can field a highly mobile force of infantry and cavalry which can respond rapidly to such corsair incursions. These foul men of Umbar are the chief danger our lands face, yet in the east the Shadow grows.\n\nMany fear that war will soon be upon us and that we will not have the strength to defend against all of the forces the great enemy calls to his banner. In spite of this, as long as men of courage and skill defend our realm there is hope. Recently, the Gondorian fleet struck a significant blow against the Corsairs' main fleet in Umbar. Under the command of the mysterious Thorongil, a faithful and skilful captain in the service of the Steward, the fleet entered the harbor under cover of darkness and burned the Black Fleet. Since then, raids on shipping have all but disappeared and the markets of Dol Amroth and Edhellond are busier than they have been for decades. Though it is a time of nominal peace and prosperity, we must remain vigilant as the Corsairs will eventually recover, rebuild, and return. We must be ready for the future; many decisions will need to be made. One thing, however, is clear. Our fate is joined with that of Gondor, if the White Tree falls, the Swan and Ship cannot long stand alone. ]]

ANDUIN_START_BODY = [[The Halls of the Bear stand as a monument to the strength of the oldest magic, near that which is called the Carrock, that ring of standing stones that marks the territory of the Beornings, the Men Who Walk as Bears. Without doubt, these men represent the truth of those that reside in the shadow of the Misty Mountains, those who dare to live under the eaves of the Mirkwood. All of us stand tall as bears, for theirs is the strength that lacks in the great southern kingdoms.\n\nIn the vales of the mighty River Anduin, there is strength not found in all of Middle-earth. Amongst Elves and Dwarves, amongst other men, there lacks the hardy, bestial nature of the Beornings, the strength of the daily struggling foresters and the hardened few who fight the strength of Goblins from the mountains. Few face the dire Wargs, who speak in voices of hate, and the eaves of Mirkwood, where even Elves fear to go. To the Men of the Anduin, these are daily bread, and they are meet them head-on. For them, the battles of the world are just an extension of day-to-day life, and the wars elsewhere ease the pressure, if anything, allowing the Anduin Vale to combine and flourish. The Hall of the Bears leads the communities that form the lifeblood of the Vale.\n\nFrom the Anduin, old tales say, comes much of the modern world. For the Hobbits dwelled here, and most Elves crossed here at least once in their dream-filled migrations; some twice, as they forgot which way they were going. It feeds the world, strides deeper than the strength of mountains, washes gently with a lovers’ caress, then pushes with the strength of a thousand Trolls. It is our life, our blood our strength, and only we call it home.\n\nIt is hard to scrape a living here, and the fight with those that would thieve your living, if not your life, makes us tough. Who but our kind can face spider of Mirkwood with sword and axe, spitting into their eyes, laughing at death, axes cutting, swords slicing until you or they lie dead, and that is all there is. That is all we ask for in life. One is strong, one is weak. One lives, one dies. That is life, and, in the Anduin, more so than ever elsewhere.\n\nThe Lordlings do not see the world as we do; they see soft cushions and wine, not stone standing free, or the wind ripping through hair as you drink ale and laugh at a storm. Few of them have seen the Bears at war, at play and seen the deepest magic at work. For in those stones lies the weight of the world. In our great hearts we carry this weight, and soon we will take it to war. A war that is no different than daily life, but we face it with a snarl, and will hurl our strength at it like we do into everything. Play, war, loving, drinking. With a savagery and a laughter that speaks of death, life and the living between both. Few allies, we of the Anduin, yet we need none. We never have had many, and fewer friends, yet we survive. More Goblin-heads to split with axe, more death, more laughter, and more strength to gain. Life IS war!! ]]

ANGMAR_START_BODY = [[Ice and wind: all that remains of the once great northern realm. In ages past, the north was a hub of activity: roads were packed with merchants passing from Carn Dûm to the Misty Mountains; war camps dotted the land as great black fissures in the bare white landscape and; great cities rose from the wastes like oases in the snow. Now however, the north is barren and empty and few remain.\n\nIn the 1300th year of the Third Age of Middle-earth, the Witch-king came to Angmar an united the squabbling lords and Orc tribes under his banner. The realm prospered and grew and for the next 675 years waged war on the Dúnedain of the north. Men and Orcs flocked to Angmar to answer the Witch-king's call and slowly but surely, the war was won. However, the blind loyalty of the northeners came at a terrible price....\n\nIn the year 1975 of the Third Age, after the last bastion of the Northern Dúnedain, Fornost, had fallen, the doom of Angmar came swift. Eärnur, Gondor's greatest military general at the time landed in Lindon with an army bent on revenge. The High Elves mustered with him and Glorfindel of the House of the Golden Flower stood side by side with Eärnur. Their combined arms decimated the army of Angmar and the Witch-king abandoned the north to its fate. The pain enacted upon the Northern Dúnedain was repaid tenfold by the Gondorians on the Angmarim: cities were utterly destroyed with nary a stone left to mark where they once stood; Orcs were routed from Angmar completely and Mt Gram was cleansed of their memory. Those few Angmarim who could keep ahead of the wave of Gondorian fury fled into the cold north. Angmar was no more....\n\nUnder the neglectful watch of Gondor however, the Angmarim slowly crept back and the fires of Carn Dûm were kindled anew. In time, this slow trickle of refugees blossomed into a fledgling nation: the fortress of Carn Dûm was repaired and the Ice Tower rebuilt; the town of Litash was captured and the long abandoned Dwarven halls beneath it were claimed; Orcs came up from the Misty Mountains and resettled in Mount Gram. Angmar was reborn!\n\nNow, in the year 2980 of the Third Age, our nation stands ready to repay the Dúnedain for the hurt of long ago. Our warriors are trained and ready, fresh steel in their hands and keen bows on their backs. The Warg tribes of Mt Gram have pledged allegiance to their old allies and stand with us, ready to hunt and scout in our name! News of our rebirth has also reached the ears of the Dark Lord who has sent forth one of his Lieutenants to command our armies and train our soldiers. As before, we are poised to bring domination to Eriador and only the scattered remnants of the Dúnedain can hope to stop us!\n\nRumours also abound amongst our men of the return of our great lord: the Witch-king! Many hold that if we are able to conquer the north in our own name, the Lord of the Nazgûl will return and lead us to ultimate glory! Imladris and Fornost must be destroyed by our hand to repay our long aged debt to the Dúnedain and then, the world will be ours... ]]

BLUEDWARVES_START_BODY = [[Ah, but the lights glisten in the halls of Ered Luin, a reminder to all of the once-proud history of our Fathers. Alas, our fortunes wane, yet we still harbour the greatest array of Dwarven bloodlines, a shrinking yet powerful progeny of the Seven Fathers. Of the Seven, Ours were greatest, and our ancestors were fell in battle, their dirges sung and sharpened axes cutting, fearful and savage to our foes of old.\n\nWhen we were resplendent, when the Ered Luin was at its height, Beleriand treated us far above equals - our smiths forged wonders that made the Elven weapons seem tarnished, even amongst those of the brilliant Ñoldor of Gondolin. Telchar was our greatest Smith, and his creations lay so greatly above all forging that Elves paid fortunes and gave pails of respect as if it were water to them. He it was who made the greatest treasures of Menegroth.\n\nThe old Kingdoms of these mountains were Grand Belegost and Fell Nogrod, yet it was the Dwarves of Nogrod that were cause for the hatred of the Elves – a relationship that was only rekindled at Khazad-dûm, a friendship with the Kingdom of Eregion. The slaying of Elu Thingol was foolish, but necessary, as he deceived us and awoke the lust we have for the bounty of the rock and stone. We have counted amongst us great Lords, such as Thorin Oakenshield, and field the best equipped and remorseless armed host west of the revived Realm of Khazad-dûm. Our decline is reversible, as is the resurrection of the might of Belegost and Nogrod. We believe still, and axe and mattock will forge a Kingdom to last an age.\n\nThe fool Elves are leaving these shores. This gives us pleasure, and mines to exploit that have not housed a Dwarf of the Ered Luin within for a great length of time. They called us Naugrim, the Stunted, and hunted us like wild animals, yet we forged and delved with adamant will and great precision. For Azaghal’s triumphant death, the Elves still owe a debt we cannot collect, but our weakness is over.\n\nWe have you, Lord, and once more don the Masks of War – whetstones are being driven; the fires belch flame as if we were already ascendant under you, Lord. Smithies provide a war engine like no other. Nothing can withstand Dwarven Foot, and, whilst limited by lesser strength in bow and lacking horse, we cut like scythes and our enemies will fall like grass. They will be in awe of the grim warriors whose spirit is strong, whose arms are great and numbers will ever grow for a war to make even the eldest look tamed. Master forges, great halls all repaired to splendour. With our strength, we will forge the way to a conquest to be sung through the halls of the Dwarves beyond the Misty Mountains, all of whom will wonder at the legends we carve.\n\nAt last we can strike at our foes, Orc and Goblin-kind, massacre them and drive them back to fall in pathetic weakness to our wrath. To the East lie ancient foes; Carn Dum itself will house many warriors amidst piles of dead and like vengeful ghosts we will fall upon the foulness of the Misty Mountains and build the greatest mines. For our goal and wish is to strike for Mithril, gold and twinkling gems as we purge the worthless spawn that are Orc-kind from the world itself!\n\nHere, deep within the Blue Mountains, have been left only a few of us, never to forget but slowly to be forgotten in these grievous ages of our decline. Of our waxing and our furious vengeance, much will be told in ages to come. The ancestors of Belegost and Nogrod will not simply die like whispers amongst embers! ]]
BLUEDWARVES_START_TITLE = [[Dwarves of Ered Luin ]]
DALE_START_BODY = [[We are proud, we men of Dale and the Laketown. Descendants of the Edain, precursors to the Dúnedain Kings, we have adapted since the three Houses left for Beleriand and the far west. We have had to adapt, for we are surrounded by enemies, and have forged relationships that keep us safe - amongst the Elves of the Woodland Realm and the stout Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain we are known as friends, friends we much need. It was the presence of Dwarves that gave our ancestors the means to settle – where others went south, we stayed, and Dale was built amongst the spurs of the Lonely Mountain.\n\nOn all borders save those we are flanked upon by our friends, there are hungry eyes waiting for us to slip and fall. To the east are the Wainriders, whom we remember well. To the south is the darkened Wood, the Mirkwood, and in there lies Dol Guldur, the 'Hill of Sorcery', as it is often known - few have seen it. We prefer to never utter its name, to simply call it the Shadow of Mirkwood, for the Black Speech is not a tongue we are pleased by. In the Brown Lands are beasts that feed off men, off our cattle, and things that slink through shadows and others that are worse. We know what we face in the future times, as we know it will come for us, for all us – far sooner than later.\n\nDale has its own tongue, but we speak Westron in the main. Ours is a form of its own, but bears semblance to the tongue of the Horse Lords of Rohan – for both of us come from Northern stock. Here in the north, there is brotherhood between men of differing cultures, for it is how we survive. We built our city in the Celduin Valley, between spurs in the south of the Lonely Mountain. It affords protection, but scant defence against an ancient danger such as a Dragon. We had one to face....King Girion died facing it; its name was Smaug the Golden, and it was attracted by the wealth we and the Dwarves generated, much as we do so again.\n\nEsgaroth, ‘Lake Town’, was the haven of our people after Smaug burned Dale and took the Lonely Mountain. Our Kings fell to ruin, much like Gondor’s heirs, and the Master of Lake Town was our ruler, but Bard I, the Dragon slayer, the Archer, kept in his veins royal blood, and the Kingdom was restored to us. We have just started to repair that which was lost and to expand. Our people number many once more, and our friends have brought much help to us – it is now in our power to restore the glory, honour and wealth that we once had. We need the focus to keep our society well – safe, with laws, and living with good intention, towards ourselves and others. We live by a code of the ancients, to a code of Faith and Honour, where wealth is not governed by base instinct, otherwise we are as lost as the Easterners are in their service to Mordor.\n\nThe River Running, the silver Celduin, is our lifeblood – the very thing that makes Dale and its lands what they are. The Dwarves do not bear water well, and the Wines for King Thranduil must be hefted up-river from distant Dorwinion. It places us in a position to benefit all, and we gather our military might from the wealth and bounty the River gives us. Armed and armoured by Dwarven smiths, we are marching, drilling, and honing our troops for the coming storm. The wealth we have accrued is as nothing without an army needed to sustain and protect it in this harsh world. Dale is strong and we not will relinquish our lands, no matter if another Dragon would come to take them from us. Neither shadow–spawn of Mordor nor Easterlings will take our lands, unless every fighting man of Dale lay dead and every town burning and blackened. We relinquish nothing to the dogs of Sauron, nor do we fear him. To him and his pawns we say come and feel the spears of the Lake-men! ]]
DALE_START_TITLE = [[Kingdom of Dale ]]
DORWINION_START_BODY = [[Dorwinion is the land of wine, ‘though it would be fair to say that we simply till the earth with greater skill than other wine-makers: a legacy of a quietly passed on legend of long-ago, if to be believed; a tale of ‘woods that oft moved', and 'spoke in lengthy wheezes of secrets of the earth'. We had friendship with these creatures and our farmers learned much in their tutelage from these elder wonders. They taught us patiently in their laborious, softly-spoken way. Whatever the truth in that, we now trade with many, a web of wealth widely spun, and we send much of our produce north, up the River Running – called the Celduin by our Elven friends – to Esgaroth, Dale, Erebor and the fairest Halls of all, in Eryn Galen.\n\nSo, trade is our essence, then. Wines that make even the Elves feel what mortals feel only too often; that is our secret. King Thranduil and his Line in Eryn Galen is our friend and ally, and there are those of the fairer race that live amongst us in honour. They live amongst us perhaps not just for our wines - for we have a heritage that traces through the tangled lines of history. Adani, they called us, the Eldar of old, and we were here before the Edain gathered their rewards for their heroism in Beleriand; but, as not all Elves went West, neither did the men we were all go West. We were the precursors of the House of Hador, later known so well for their tragic heroes rather than their wondrous wines. Which, I wonder, is the greater in its lasting?\n\nThere is irony sunk deep within this, for we are as noble as we have ever been, have endured wars between the Dúnedain and the tribes of the South and vicious warriors of the East. An uneasy peace, never acknowledged, lies between us and the inhabitants of vast Rhûn. We even till our lands using their Kine, those great white oxen that dwell on the shores of the inland sea. These are the very same that King Vorondil hunted and slew to make the great Horn of Gondor – but there is no friendship with their masters to be found. Nor will there ever be, and we see much unrest along the shores of the Inner Sea.\n\nOur merchants and our allies run true, as if they were the very lifeblood of our kingdom, yet our military follows the patterns of those we treat with. Organised along the lines of those of the Lake Men of Dale and Esgaroth for the greater part, we have a dualistic society, fostered by the Elves amongst us, and our people have learned their ways of war in turn. We have traded good money for the weapons of the Dwarves; few in number, yet effective all the same. We fight when it is needed, yet are not warlike in manner. There is a coming storm – movement in the East, vast herds and many wains moving around the Sea of Rhûn; shadows gather around the mountains of Mordor, and glints of flame and lightning gutter feebly in our eyes, but we are distant from whatever evils transpire therein. To the folk of Gondor, the tragic remnants of the Edain bloodlines, it must be enough to make them cower in the face of the storm, like a crack in a war-smith’s anvil.\n\nWhen called to war, we will not side in any way other than we have in the past: we are the Atani, as all good men were before Beleriand, and we will fight for our friends: both Elves and Men. These we would choose to die for and with, and the East is no friend, leaving Mordor and the Shadow in Mirkwood. There is little choice there; if forced to war, we will use the wealth of our bounteous lands to pay for it. Our armed forces are not fat and lax, they drill with precision and we bear weapons made by Men and Dwarves, bows of Greenwood the Great, and the skill of the Northmen we have absorbed over many centuries trains our cavalries. When war comes, Dorwinion will be ready, IS ready. As one, we await our fate, our survival, or our doom. ]]

DUNEDAIN_START_BODY = [[Long we have remained hidden from the eyes of the Enemy, operating in the shadows, fighting His cause across Middle-earth for generations of our noble line. Many would accuse us of cowardice, of not living up to our responsibilities, but we face death each and every day, as we shield those unable to defend themselves. Some call us ‘Rangers’, as if it were a derogatory term. Whether it is from wolves, Trolls or worse – and there are things in the dark that make these foes pale by comparison, and we have met and faced them, now as in our past. Even our ancient dead have turned upon us, and our old world is but a memory, distant glories those of song and funeral dirge.\n\nWe preserve the bloodlines of old Númenor, of the four ships of Elendil that held much magnificence and hope in a day that is long past, appearing only in the embers of our dreams, in poetry and verse, in mouldering records kept in a few of the greater libraries of this world. For we hide the bloodlines of the Kings of Men, of the Kingdom of Arnor, the ill-fated realm that split into three at the death of the last King of Arnor, Eärendur. Although we hide, we turn the tide of war against our foe, and his eyes search everywhere for us, for he fears the blood of Númenor.\n\nGlorious was the Kingdom of Arnor, and those that followed, Arthedain in the west, that lay from Gil-galad’s gift of the White Towers of Elostirion by the River Lune, to the River Baranduin. Annúminas was theirs, as was the capital at Fornost Erain. Cardolan lay in the south of Arnor, between the Baranduin, through to the Greyflood, containing the Great East Road of Elf and Dwarf, in the now ruinous city of Tharbad, once great. Treacherous Rhudaur fell into shadow, but in its glory lay in the east, from the Weather Hills and Amon Sûl, where the three met, to the very borders of Imladris and the Misty Mountains.\n\nGreat was our history, too much to tell, of the Seven Kings of Arnor, and the palantír, the three, that caused much of our woes. There was jealousy there, and the Kingdoms of both Cardolan and Rhudaur greatly desired the seeing-stone of Amon Sûl, but it was denied them, even at the end. Even when Arvedui, King of Arthedain and his sons died at sea, with the loss of the two palantír of Amon Sûl and Annúminas. Malbeth the Seer predicted him the last of Arthedain, and his surviving son Aranarth took the Chieftainship of the Dúnedain in Exile, after plague, war and treachery, the Witch-king’s machinations, all failed to utterly destroy us. Still we live; between Lindon, Imladris and the North Downs we are scattered, and the traditions are all that hold us - that and the surviving blood of kings that runs in our chieftains.\n\nOhtar, Squire of Isildur, brought the Shards of Narsil to Imladris, where we added the Sceptre of Annúminas and the ancient Ring of Barahir, given unto the Edain in the times of the First Age in sign of the friendship of all Elves. A tradition began which saw our chieftains fostered in Imladris, to train in safety in their youth, so that they may yet unite the kingdoms of old reborn. The time has come, at last, for us to think of what was and make it so again. The wise still speak of a time when Cardolan, Arthedain and Rhudaur will be united and populated again, and the mistakes of our ancestors be wiped from history save as a reminder, a warning to those of future lines. We possess the one man who could unite the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor once more. His name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and his is the power that could overturn the Stewardship that has served Middle-earth well in the south, and announce to all the Return of the King. With trumpets and blazoned banners the Dúnedain will call the notes of dynasty that has long remained unheard. The Grey Company will ride in war, and all will fall before our irrepressible charge.\n\nThe way will not be of ease. We are comparatively few, and our allies may be the stronger part of our hope, yet there are enough to make our dreams true. There are others who will follow our early days in war, and they remember, but have lost hope – they remember the alliance that overthrew the Witch-king at Fornost, and will do their part again. The Elves, the folk of Bree-land, the scattered folk of Eregion. They will answer our call, and we may yet find allies in the Dwarves, for they are stronger than they fear they are not. The greater West is our land of friendship and alliance, trade is good, and the strength of Men is beyond recall. Together we will make songs of old live again, bring the words of poets out of the pages of books, and the memory of great Arnor will take form from all of this.\n\nOur Aragorn has fought in wars across Middle-earth, leading the sacking of Umbar, fighting in the armies of Gondor. He has ridden alongside our people in secrecy, his flashing blade carving the fury of lost times across the lines of our enemies. He has fought beside the folk of Elrond, has become great in wisdom and the art of war, and he has allies - the sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir are with us and any of us would die for him gladly, for he is a great man, and his destiny is larger than any chieftain before him. Days of glory await, and he truly has the strength to bring back the twin Kingdoms and best Sauron in his own lair of deepening Shadow. ]]

DUNLENDING_START_BODY = [[We are the Dunlendings! We remember that our distant ancestors were among those that travelled to Beleriand, but they stayed in the wooded lands around the River Gwathló, that which the Men of Númenor called ‘River of Shadow’, but to us it was home. We are scattered clans, led by our brenins, yet united under our king, who sits in Byrig. Long have we warred with Rohan and Gondor, ‘civilized’ people who drove us from our lands upon the plains of Rohan like animals. The ‘horse lords’ of Rohan have continued to hunt us like vermin. They are not lords in truth, but land thieves whom we have called the Forgoil, or strawheads.\n\nBefore the Númenóreans came, we lived with the Drúedain, men of the woods like us, and together we dwelt in the Great Forest, living in the lost city of Athámor, cherishing the Tír Croícoill, the Heart of the Forest. We heard whispers of the Númenóreans and warned the others. They ignored us, and our lands were sized from us, and we fled to the east, carrying a sacred wooden circlet carved from the wood of the Tír Croícoill. Our legends speak that the first Dunlending brenin was led to Byrig by a flock of Crebain, who followed them to their nesting tree, high atop a hill, a hill from which a spring flowed. And thus, did the Crebain become his symbol, and Byrig was built around the hill. When the tree perished, we carved it into a throne for the High-Brenin, for as we flourished in the land, despite its hardness, one clan became many, and there grew a need for an overall leader to settle disputes.\n\nEach clan has its patron animal, with the sacred Crebain being the patron of all Dunland. Each Dunlending belongs to his clan, and a talon, for there are three talons, the woods, hills and plains, one for each claw of the crebain. Our ways are known as the Dunhird, sacred traditions that govern our bond with the land, traditions that forbade the use of animals in battle, for no true Dunlending warrior would need a mere animal to succeed, for his skill alone is enough.\n\nWe soon found new and plentiful lands in the plains that are now known as the Calenardhon, from the Adorn to Isengard. It was empty, and we made it ours. Yet Gondor considered us to be wildmen and men of the shadow, for the crime that we refused to accept them as our lords, despite their ancestors’ crimes against the Great Forest, for it was they who burnt it and drove us from Athámor. And they ‘gave’ our lands to the men of Rohan and we were driven from them unjustly. We tried to resist but between the horses of Rohan and the blades of Gondor, we were cut down and forced to flee into our ancestral homes in the hills of Dunland.\n\nAnd so we remained for many long years, in an uneasy cold war with our enemies. Clans may have raided Gondor and Rohan, but they would be repulsed and when we were raided in turn, we ensured our foes never returned to their homelands and met their deaths in our hills. We eventually won the tower of the Orthanc, dealing a blow against our enemies and interbreeding between Dunland and Rohan led to a man with our blood, Freca commanding much power in Rohan. He proposed a marriage between his line and the royal line, seeking to bring peace between Rohan and Dunland and Helm Hammerhand murdered him for the ‘crime’ of asking. His son Wulf, and his retainers and allies fled to our lands, and we welcomed them. The High-Brenin, the Brenin of the Faolan-lûth, had died shortly before, bedridden and in a grand melee to decide the next High-Brenin, Wulf, with his allies from Rohan and the Faolan-lûth, used a blend of Rohirric and Dunlending tactics that he learned from his father Freca to dominate and claim the mantle of ruler. He had convinced the Faolan-lûth to ally with him, as there was evidence their previous brenin had been assassinated and he vowed vengeance against the suspected clan.\n\nOver the next few years, he travelled among us and consolidated our military and formed an elite force of infantry that answered to him, known as the King’s Warband. To his friends and allies he gifted fine arms and armour, dubbing them the Wulfguard. He even united the sparse Dunlendings who used cavalry in the form of Dunlending ponies, who had long faced ostracism from breaking from the Dunhird, with his own mounted Rohirric allies into a force he called the Frekkalingir, in memory of his father Freca. He passed his father’s tactics onto them, creating a fine and deadly force. He even married a Dunlending woman, Drüalphíen of the Faolan-lûth.\n\nOn account of all of this, he convinced the brenins of Dunland to anoint him as king on the condition that he led us to Edoras. Only the Faolan-lûth broke with him, with their brenin challenging him to a duel, in which Wulf won and crippled the man, leaving him his life as a mercy. And so, they fled to join our weak and forgiving kin in Enedwaith, and were stripped of their status, becoming known only as the Faolan. Nevertheless, Wulf kept his promise and led us to Edoras and was anointed a Twofold King of Dunland and Rohan, claiming for us untold riches and wealth, and a bounty of fine steeds we took back to Dunland. Our legends even claim he slew Helm Hammerhand and was only undone and slain by treachery. It was strong willed and bold Drüalphíen who led us back and safeguarded his infant son. And it is his line who rule us now, commanding our might\n\nWe have made little gains since, with the Orthanc even being lost and given to the White Wizard Saruman, and have few friends, yet now may be the time for us to seize our birthrights for there are whispers Rohan and Gondor are weakening and the Shadow rising. To our east lies Rohan, whom we will see cast down. To our south lies foul Gondor, and although we wish to seek vengeance, for now they are too great. Our ideal expansion would be against our weak-willed kin to the west in Enedwaith. Like us, they claim descent from Athámor, yet unlike us they are weak and have chosen to forgive our foes instead of persecuting them in the name of justice and vengeance. They are an ideal target for expansion, and there are those in both Enedwaith and Rohan who will fight and support our cause, knowing it is just. Our forces are also loyal and willing, whether they are the Dunhird, the King’s Warband, the brenins or the Frekkalingir. There are even rumours Saruman is sympathetic to our cause and may offer aid.

ENEDWAITH_START_BODY = [[We are beset by danger at every turn; wild wolves prey on our people, but we hunt them at all times, bringing them down but never destroying them – much like the world and our people. We were greatly troubled with the ‘highest of men’ – not so high when they come and savage your forest, tear down the bulk of what was your home and our capital of eld, Athámor. That is bitterness of many hundreds of years of time’s passing, and we do not keep it; it flows through us like water through hands.\n\nOur greater friends were the Drúedain, not the Dúnedain, but we respect them and remember what it was like to have true unity. Order and fealty, protection and persecution. Long we have lived upon a double sided coin, an ironic existence, both hunted for our actions in defence of our forest and needed for the wars in the north – the levy men of Cardolan, we were. We lived with honour, fought and died for it, and never gave in.\n\nOur history sustains us, and we will see it restored – it is what keeps us sleeping at night, albeit with one eye open, and what gives us our courage- to gather around camp fires and talk of better times, of the histories. Passed down through generations our histories are, and they fill us with hope and sustain lives that are desperately in need of a common cause. Perhaps there is one among us who will lead the clans to unite and take on our foes with common voice and hand. \n\nWe are a mixed people. Within our borders lie villages of fisher folk, deep in the woods are great bowmen, hunters, whilst in the open ground are villages of a people who battle each day to remember our past and carry on in the hope that it will be restored. Our people are divided, and it may be that we unite by force, or under the banner of one such as you, my chieftain. A great leader who can unite us and unify the scattered remnants of our people is what we need, and I feel you may be the one we have waited for. This gives me great pleasure, and it is an honour to serve you!\n\nWhat we lack in honed military skill we make up for in our tenacity and honour in combat. We follow our chieftains to death, and would sustain them even beyond this. From the old ruins our people will come, from the fishing villages and from forest and plain. They will all fight and die for you without question, and with considerable ferocity. It is not that we lack skill; we lack unity enough to drill men, to bind them together and fight with discipline like other men do. Unlike the men of Dunland, we do not hold the bitterness of past history, we use it to look forward, not to strain to see the flip side of that coin and keep hatred in our hearts. The men of ancient Cardolan are on the rise, and the foes that prey upon us had best be careful, lest they find a united cause that binds us in bands of iron and them in the shadow of death. We are ready to war with others, to take our cause and unite again– that is enough for now. ]]

This is our realm, the power of the Dwarves in the easternmost edge of the Western sphere, where Longbeards and Broadbeams delve into the lambent and virtually inexhaustible veins of precious metals that provide the power and wealth of our King Dáin II. This is the Power of the Iron Hills of old, the Dwarf Realm at the borders of those we regard as foes in the Eastern man-realms, farthest from the Blue Mountains, where our people fade. It was he that marched five hundreds of our warriors to contest the claim of the Elves of the Woodland Realm and the Lake men’s ignorant demands upon the mountain, their attempt to thieve from the rightful acclamation of Thorin Oakenshield, bearer of Orcrist.\n\nSadly, Thorin Oakenshield was lost in this brief clash of differences, but our timely arrival won the Battle of Five Armies, a battle that saw our final revenge upon the line of Azog. We relished in the slaying of Bolg of the Misty Mountains, Azog's son in vain. This wondrous act forever weakened the Goblins’ hold on that far domain. Our arrival was not timely by fate alone, for Dwarves may not be fast, as Elves are in war, but we have such strength that we march for days without rest, on limited rations – hard tack and dried meat – as the Iron Hills have birthed us to do. The ravens still remember us, their wings bringing word of events afar.\n\nDáin II is our King, the greatest Lord of Dwarves, rich and strong beyond any man’s line, robust and bold beyond the strength of Elves and Men. Balin, of Fundin’s blood, reclaims Moria, the Kingdom of Khazad-dûm, and no other Dwarven Realm shows strength enough to support this as we do, albeit against Dáin's will. Alone of all races, we remained resistant to the devilry contained within in the dark gifts that lay like poison in the Seven Dwarven Rings. They spelt our doom, however, as the dragons hunted us for them and the riches they brought us - as did Sauron, to recover that which did not work to his ends.\n\nWe have renewed our friendship with the Ravens, and they float in flight upon our war banners as we prepare for war once more. More, we have turned the wary silence between the Dwarves and the Men of Dale into a grand friendship which has brought bounty in ways we cannot possibly provide for ourselves. Their trade has brought prosperity to their people and brought our survival and a true friendship we do not enjoy elsewhere. If our efforts fall to destitution, they have our Hold to retreat to, and Erebor is impenetrable to almost any foe.\n\nWe are threatened by the machinations of Sauron once more, and we will not give in – resistance is our very nature, hardy Aulë’s children of rock and stone. Preparations are underway for you to lead our armies to victory, but it will not be easy, for we are not numberless. We will face the Easterlings, Orcs from Dol Guldur and our enmity with dead Bolg’s Goblin-kin shall surely erupt once more. The Shadow gathers its allies, and we stand in the face of Sauron in the north, where we shield even the Elves from his terrible intent.\n\nWe are well-suited to this final war. Dáin has amassed riches beyond compare – our mines lay deep and our armouries are well stocked with master-smith’s fashioning of arms and armour. The Mattocks and mail of the very Dwarves to fight Bolg in the past will sing in a shrill war-paean once more, and the blood of black Goblins - and the thin blood of man - will surely spill across battlefields. Our strength is augmented by our great friends in Dale – the toys we make for their children have won us a deserving friendship that gives our forces hope, strength unbound, in that we do not stand alone. Never a stronger Dwarven realm has there been since the glorious days of Khazad-dûm! ]]

GALADHRIM_START_BODY = [[I am Galadriel, Lady of Light, of Lórien, Lady of the Woods. Many things they call me – the Naugrim truly see me in a Fey light – witch indeed! I was born in Valinor, though I succumbed to the temptation of the Middle-earth, and followed the Ñoldor to Beleriand before it fell below Ulmo’s waters. Here I was gathered in by King Elu Thingol, Lord of the Sindar and husband to Melian. I have heard the Dúnedain sing the Song of Beren and Lúthien from afar, and knew her in my time. Princess of the Ñoldor and Queen of the Silvan Elves am I: my grandmother was Vanyar, the fairest and wisest of all Elves, who never left the Undying Lands, teachers and students of the greatest lore.\n\nPerhaps I suffer the woe of vanity in this pride, but it is what makes me able to bear the weight of Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, that binds mine and my peoples’ worlds and futures. Whilst it seems bright under the stars, my mirror feeds tendrils of doubt into my mind. I see great potential for a future of treachery of close-held friends. The White Council is wise, and we hold power still, but there is a...reluctance from some - Mithrandir loses himself in his Hobbits (much as we have lost Radagast), and Saruman the White leans precariously into the elder lore of Ring-craft. We delay when I see coming darkness, and I have seen many a future where all lies under shadow – that, however, is the curse of my gift that is my mirror.\n\nA catalyst has been set in motion, and I am alone, standing at the very edge of the existence of Elves upon these lands. The Bearer of a Ring of Power carries the weight of the world upon them, and I see much around me begin to fade into uncertainty and doubt. My mirror of Nimrodel’s clear waters shows me much of Sauron’s Will and the White Council may yet fail in our efforts to stem the tide he unleashes. I see the very might of Mordor, the plight of the weakened race of man, yet my realm stands on the balance. Should we stand alongside Men, when their need is greatest, or shall my people follow the longing and go to the West in the swan ships of the Teleri?\n\nThe Galadhrim, my marchwardens of Caras Galadhon, are not without strength and great skill, and the Ring Nenya gives me the power to hold time in my kingdom, to sustain and heal my domain, but do I follow my yearning yet? Do we owe men a war? The great Mallorn trees house us – nurture and protect us, but we are at constant threat from the Goblins of dank Moria and the Shadow and Flame that slumbers or else awakens. Of old we know these demons, and there the insanity of the Dwarves comes to the fore once again! They think they can contain it, these few hundreds, this Balin, son of Fundin. So much stock in names! They will need more than just themselves, and where do they think they will find it? Do we owe anything to those that woke the terror of old, the Valaraukar that even we Ñoldor at our height could not simply ‘contain’?\n\nThat said, the greater threat lies in that of Dol Guldur to come, for I have seen it – the delays of the White Council in purging its taint may have undone Lórien! We have few friends upon this side of the Misty Mountain: the Elves of Eryn Lasgalen, the Court of Thranduil, are far away and relations with the Dwarves (should they survive what they have started) and with Balin will prove strained at best.\n\nMy mirror shows what is, what was and what will be, but I see the Great Eye in my dreams and have watched the rebuilding of Barad-dûr. The threat to Gondor is great, but there is strength there; strength beyond the Dúnedain, who hide, nevertheless great in their bloodlines. The Ñoldor of Imladris are leaving these shores and I would yearn to leave too, but I have seen the birth of something rare ahead, and mean to see it either fall from the path of light, or see a tiny sliver of hope bear fruit. Sometimes there are things, sometimes necessities that keep us from some of our desires; Valar, am I not done with the mortal world yet, or is it not done with me?\n\nDark times are upon us indeed. Elves cannot stand alone, yet they have power still to act. Is that not what is important? We stand at the crucible of the Elves’ future upon these lands and must decide our path by the will of our own.\n\nMy husband is one of the greatest war masters of the ages and my people can yet hold off assaults on Lórien, but do we have the strength to take the war to the foe themselves? If we do (and we must), then our tale is not yet done. Lord Celeborn, lead the woods of Lórien to war and I see the possibility of victory – a possibility is not yet enough, but oft have we lived on hope alone. Make war on the Enemy and perhaps Man will not simply wither under the onslaught of Mordor, on the vicious blade of the Orcs, and the Trolls that walk in daylight. Manwe’s Great Eagles have not yet given to despair and neither will Lórien. My Lord, we must fight, albeit to our doom. Tragedy will strike my people and only you can save us in the days ahead. Together we will live in Anor’s Light, Elbereth’s Stars or fall into Shadow. Lead us to either, Lord, for hope is everything. ]]

Our blood keeps other lands safe from the depredations of Mordor, and, with its full weight fixed upon us, we hold our lines and know our wars are not for nothing, yet, ever still, we bleed.\n\nIn our lands we more than hold on to the greatly disputed areas east of the old city of Osgiliath, perhaps more ruin than city itself now, but a matter of pride in our hearts. North of Osgiliath lies the garrison at Cair Andros, the fine island that divides the great Anduin River before it flows with such silvery strength down past Pelargir to the sea and leads us from thence to Linhir, which coastline strikes through the Southern Fiefs; Lebennin, Lamedon, the Principality of Dol Amroth in Belfalas, from whence come our levies in time of need.\n\nMuch has been lost of our Kingdom, much that once was, and we weep for it. No blossom upon the White Tree, where the Fountain Court keeps its watch, and the Stewards have fought without relent to retain what was once the flower of the Kings of Númenor. The blood runs thin amongst our people – only in few lives the legacy of Númenor, and middle-man is weaker than ever. I am sorry, Lord, for my fears ever grow, yet I hold on to your grace for what will be. The line of Kings may have failed, but we have Stewards of great wisdom and of iron will.\n\nSecret despair feeds our dreams, yet we do not count it during the waking hours – for the light keeps the cowardice of the Orc from our walls and the White City shines still, even as it slowly crumbles. Its defences are undermanned, but indeed we still have such faith in the strength of man and stone. Strong walls and brazen gates are our defence, even if our forces fail, and surely the Red Arrow and the beacons – both or either will bring the old alliance with the Horse Lords of Rohan to a tumult, and they will ride to our aid. With the forces of the Southern Fiefs, the mainstay of our army and Rohan’s bright riders, how can we truly let go of our hope, for it is what sustains us in these bleak times.\n\nI whisper as if all were lost already, my Lord, but it is not so. With our Captains lie the fate of many, and such Captains of Men we have! The eyes of the White Tower – the Tower of Ecthelion – are never blind to what Sauron is planning. In contested Ithilien our Rangers, fired with the blood of old, with the skill nigh of the Dúnedain themselves, defend our borders and keep the thrice-damned Southrons at bay, whilst our victories shiver the very gates of Mordor itself.\n\nThe Poisons of that land, the foulness in the Dark, all are kept contained by our Lords. Yet still we wait for the old times, for the Tree to flower and the trumpets to announce that the King has returned! Turn to the Swan Princes for hope, for they still run true, and in Dol Amroth we see echoes of the past. Fair blood in their lines, even whispered to be mixed within by the beauty of the Elves. A single glance will show the truth of their nobility, and marriage preserves the old lines in both the Swan Princes and the great Stewards that sit and await a King once more. Hope remains amongst the common people, and there is much of import that can still be done.\n\nDo we simply defend what is ours? Do we simply dig in and hold? Or would the Steward that you could be take Gondor forwards again? Do you hear the clash of arms, dream of shivered shield and cloven helm, to see the blood of Orcs staining Mordor’s blackened heart and the sun shining red upon the field of valour? The Port of Umbar fell to us before now, and it may be that Harad can be not only be pushed back, but broken, sundered, that the Black Ships could joyfully burn, or be smashed at sea by a fleet such as we could raise in the great ports of Pelargir, Linhir and Dol Amroth.\n\nAll is not lost, and we are mightier than many think or even many know yet. My heart swells to see your strident grace Lord, and the men drink with cheer at the sight of the Steward of Gondor! Could we break the lines of Mordor, crush the advances of the Southrons and burn Umbar? We could do more than that with hope, the steel of our hearts and the leadership of a great man. In old walked Dúnedain; giants among men, but that does not mean our backs are less straight, that our hearts are less courageous, and that we are doomed by the failing of simple blood. Take us to our destiny, Steward of Gondor – lead us to WAR!! ]]

HARAD_START_BODY = [[The lands known as Harad are vast, diverse, and often times unforgiving. Some regions hold sweltering deserts with dunes as tall as mountains. Some regions play host to steamy jungles filled to the brim with life. Still other regions of Harad contain barren wastelands that stretch as far as the eye can see and beyond. The peoples who make their homes here, the Haradrim, are an ancient and war-like people. Like the lands they inhabit, they are quite a diverse grouping of peoples. Though, they all have unique customs, dress, and methods of war, they all share two things in common; a burning hatred of Gondor and an uncanny ability to thrive in difficult conditions. All Haradrim hold an individual's strength and force of will in the highest regard for only the strongest survive in these lands, and only those stronger still can hope to lead these people. If we would seek to lead all the tribes of Harad we must prove our strength by conquering as many lesser tribes and regions as we can!\n\nThe most powerful of the Haradrim tribes are always looking to increase the size of their dominion and they often form powerful tribal confederations and city states. The most well know tribes are; the Mûhad, a nomadic group of expert camel riders and javelinmen; the Hasharii, a highly secretive group that trains its warriors in the art of double bladed warfare, a rare sight in Middle-earth; and the Troll-men, fierce warriors with inhuman strength and mastery over the feared Mûmakil.\n\nOf course, our own tribe, the Tribe of the Black Serpent, stand as the most powerful of all. We are led by Serpent-Lord Khûzaymáh. A man, it is whispered, whom can converse with snakes! He has many powerful allies but chiefest of these is the Dark Lord of Mordor himself! The Great Eye is rumored to have granted Khûzaymáh the gift of snake speech in return for his loyalty and a pledge to unite Harad under Sauron's name. To that end Khûzaymáh has made a strong alliance with a relatively unknown Variag Khan named Arkísh. This eager Khan has agreed to send some of his own warriors to fight for the Serpent so long as our alliance is maintained.\n\nThe Harnen River is the lifeblood of Harad. Not only is it the largest source of water for hundreds of miles in many directions, it is also used as a sort of highway for trade and troop movements. We of the Black Serpent control the city of Faen'obel and maintain our dominion of the Harnen from this great city, or in the local tongue it is known as the "Jewel of the Harnen." Only Umbar itself can match it in size and splendor.\n\nFrom his palace in Faen'obel, Serpent-Lord Khûzaymáh has a very strategic position from which to dominate these lands! To the South lies the Haradwaith, controlled by the Troll-men with their Mûmakil. Vast, wild, and filled with many potential resources to exploit it would be a hard fought but rewarding prize. To the East lies the Avallô Jungle and flood plains, where the Harnen is bolstered by hundreds and hundreds of tributaries. These lands are fertile and wealthy. To the West lie the two coastal cities of Gobel Mirlond and Caldûn, these cities' coastal location will provide ample oppurtunites for trade. To the North are the lands of Harondor, where we will most certainly meet our most hated enemies, the filthy Gondorians.\n\nWhere will we spread our domain to first? It would be unwise to attack Gondor until we have gained more support from other tribes. The Haradrim understand strength better than most, conquering more territory will undoutedly bring more tribes to join our cause and allow us to construct mighty cities and strongholds! Once we have united the disparate tribes of Harad as one, we can bring the fight to Gondor itself! We will avenge our countless ancestors who died by their wicked blades! The Great Eye will bath us with His glorious gaze! ]]

IMLADRIS_START_BODY = [[My Lord, Erestor has returned from Mithlond, bearing news from Círdan! The Havens of Lindon gird themselves for war, as it has been foreseen by you. Imladris will stand alone for the time being – Lindon’s concerns are elsewhere as of this day. Círdan sees great danger from the south, and foretells of the doom written in the stars on the finest clear nights. We stand against all threats, as we have done before, but the most immediate lies in the Misty Mountains, the centre of our concerns for many years. Evil mobilises, My Lord, and Imladris must answer! Imladris must prepare for War.\n\nImladris is the ‘Last Homely House West of the Mountains’, the province of Elrond the Half-Elven, Lord of Imladris, and inheritor of the Ring Vilya, greatest of the Three Elven Rings. Located in a narrow gorge along the River Bruinen, Gil-galad sent Lord Elrond to gather the refugees from the fall of Eregion, the Kingdom of Hollin, where the Rings of Power were forged. Driven north to Rhudaur, they settled and fortified the Riven-Dell, or Imladris in the Sindar tongue. Founded in the Second Age, after this retreat from Sauron’s forces, Imladris was besieged for three years, until the siege was relieved by the army of Gil-galad, come fresh from Lindon.\n\nImladris’s history has seen many battles in many wars, always defending to ensure the survival of this Last Homely House. It was assaulted by the armies of the Witch-king of Angmar, which were only driven off by the Elves of Lórien after a siege numbering years. It has been proven that Imladris is more than capable of defending itself, and is a difficult target to besiege due to the nature of the gorge it lies in, and because of the River Bruinen itself, which rises to its defence under the power of the Elven Ring, Vilya.\n\nLong has there been a tradition in Imladris that the heirs of the Dúnedain Kings are kept safe within, trained in the skills of war and survival, before they are given to the thin remnant of their people, to lead them until the Return of the King, Lord of both Gondor and Arnor of old – the Reunited Kingdom. The relationship between the Northern Dúnedain and Imladris will be crucial to its developing story, as it faces numerous foes, and it’s list of allies grows short.\n\nElrond has an army of the Eldar; Ñoldor of old, led by the lords Elladan, Elrohir and Glorfindel, ‘Lord of the House of Golden Flower’ of Gondolin. Glorfindel is the only living being to have been ‘brought back’ from the Halls of Mandos, and slew a Balrog single-handedly, albeit to his own ruin. Sent back with the Istari, he is a testament to eras past but for the time being he is away and we know not when he will return. Elrond’s forces are great warriors of vastly superior skill in battle. To this end, Imladris will play a major part in the war which surely follows, but is limited in strength of numbers and cannot easily rectify any mistakes made early in the war.\n\nAs the only safe Haven near the Misty Mountains in the west, Imladris enjoys fine trade and Lord Elrond is a collector of lore, gathered from travellers who all must take the long road through the Misty Mountains to either east or west. It must make firmer allies in its own part of the war that will soon engulf Middle-earth, as, although its armies are of the best, only through a strong economy and stronger allies can it achieve victory. Middle-earth is divided and Imladris stands at the crossroads of all lands in the West. They have an ideal location for dominion during this cataclysmic era, but must in turn stand in the way of danger from all directions – Carn-Dum to the north, Moria to the south and countless others, who all see the conquest of Imladris as vital to their own war efforts. It will not be an easy task to win this war, but Imladris has the power to do so, even within the limits it so clearly exhibits. ]]

ISENGARD_START_BODY = [[We are the fighting Uruk-hai! We are the servants of Saruman the Wise, The White Hand: The Hand that gives us man's flesh to eat. We came out of Isengard!\n\nSmoke rises from the pits of Orthanc, black foulness that spirals endlessly into the sky. The fires of industry are at work, and their goal is the very destruction of the race of Man. Saruman the wise, the White Wizard – chief of the Order of Istari – has betrayed the White Council and all that is free in Middle-earth. Transparent now, his plans, for the deep study of Ring-Lore and the lethargy of the White Council’s movements against the Necromancer of Dol Guldur become apparent for what they are. The machinations of Saruman are revealed, and many will die for his treachery.\n\nThere is no idle adoration between the Mighty Curunir, Wizard of Many Colours, and The Great Eye but the wizard has used the palantír of Orthanc, gazed upon the fully revealed power of Mordor and its allies, and done the only wise thing: he has joined with the Dark Lord, the revelation of which shall send shudders through the faith and security of all of the powers of the West. Commanded by his belief in what he does, Saruman commits the only traitorous act of his time as an Istari – to rebuild Isengard in the image of Mordor itself. Pits in the earth, the damming of the Entwash and forges of intense heat, fed by the useless wood of the forests that used to line Orthanc’s inner paths.\n\nHis eyes turn to farther regions; all is fuel for his fires, his new industry of war. All is fodder for the time of the Orc, to dominate through terror and with an iron fist. A new breed of Orc, standing taller, less bow-legged, stronger, faster and obedient to those with power, and loyal only to the one that bred them. Saruman’s Orcs, the savage ‘Fighting Uruk-hai’ are even above the Black Uruks of Mordor. He has perfected the twisting of the creatures that Melkor stole and tortured ruinously in the pits of Utumno. The warriors of the White Hand are a match for Man at last, and the hated Sun does not scare them, merely making them simply uneasy in its undeniable way.\n\nAlongside the savage Uruk-hai, he has found others, whose hate of the Rohirrim is above his, more personal and historical - hatred more base than that of a studier of insects rolling in the filth. The Dunlendings, formerly wild lords of parts of Rohan, are his to summon as allies – Saruman’s half-truths and ignition of their belligerent nature has led to enough leverage, enough manipulation to gain allies that will fight on his side with as much hate as the Orcs muster. Saruman is a master of magic, and a master of the sly tongue. He has strange influence over others, and his powers stretch to gather in other servants – Crebain crows serve him now, and wild wolves of the north... all will bow to the White Hand, and Saruman will rival Sauron himself!\n\nRohan, the land of horse-sweat, is ripe for the taking, even with the strength it has, for they will expect nothing of what is planned. War with Rohan, however, is a means to an end, and will be accomplished by more than force of arms. The Hand of Orthanc is reaching far to secure its wants and its faithless needs. Fangorn forest will burn, and the fires of Isengard will reach across to destroy the world of man. The Elves are leaving, and man stands alone. It is time for Saruman to usher in the time of the Orc and the time of this Wizard of Many Colours! ]]

KHAND_START_BODY = [[Our land is one of grasses, wind and the open sky. We measure our lands by the distance of days, or weeks, and the passing of seasons. Long days pass by, and we sing around our camp fires at night, love and laugh together; for what is the use of passing through to the earth without experiencing it to the fullest? I have missed one of the greatest things in life, a thing we do well, and we love as much as our women and children: We love one thing more than this Earth and sky; we love War! We love it deeply, and we are good at it.\n\nOnly in battle are you truly alive. To feel the apprehension before, to delight in wetting the earth in an hour more times than in one day’s passing, then of the swift clash of arms, the tiredness, the splash of bright blood and the feeling of armour parting under a swift strike. What more is there than the sight of the surprise as you rip your axe free, to bury it deep in another blow, a finishing strike that sees another life leaving quickly dimming eyes.\n\nTo be alive after, to sing victory, to drink yourself to a stupor, and pass out with the realisation you did not die, you passed the test of arms, and that your body will not rot or burn with the ones that failed the test of war. In the winning, you absorb more, you take the women, and slay the men if they do not give themselves over to you and your own. For this is how we grow strong; we defeat utterly, kill many, and then give servitude to those who accept it, making us stronger as a whole. For, amongst the steppes, there are many tribes of Khand, many Variags, and we seek to consolidate, to gather to our banners the greatest force.\n\nOne day all will fight under one, the strongest, and then we will have conquered the world. Now, that day, glorious day, will be the last, as what more is there for we Variags? What then? All do not see as I do, but the days pass and more are taken. Soon we will turn to the other lands, beyond our own. I yearn for this day, and it may be before we are full to brimming – when I am the tribal chief, we will march upon this Gondor, this Rohan, and teach even Gorthaur what subservience is.\n\nTo the West, where the Rhûn lies, beyond which lie the one they call ‘Lord’, Sauron, Gorthaur. They worship him as a god. Beyond them lie lands rich and fat, grasses of green, verdant and flush with weakness we do not feel ourselves. Settled lands, where we can see walls of stone that Dwarf anything we have seen in our times-before. In the distant past, we have joined with the warbands of Rhûn, and we have fought the ones with the silver armour, bearing the banner of black, with a white tree emblazoned. There is our test, for we have not yet beaten them, nor have the Easterlings destroyed them, even with the aid of the Southrons and their dark allies. Even the Blue-one’s treachery to his masters cannot aid them in this.\n\nBut there is more than this to us. There is the war between the unfamiliar concepts of this ‘good’ and ‘evil’. We have met with emissaries of both sides of this fickle coin, and heard the words they speak. The ones in Blue spoke with some jaded wisdom, and they kept their Power hidden, cloaked, but we knew, and they were tested – one failed in this testing, and was lost - Pallanto, his name – the other, Alatar, went to the others, of whom I shall speak. The ones in black came before us, emanating fear such as has never been felt, their power displayed in such vagrant might. Both were listened to – there are those amongst us that profess to their devotion to one side or the other, but the steppe was too vast to be bound by something this...organised. We are too free to become bound by an organised goal; this is why we live as we do. Why we love and laugh and war, and why we gather in more and more, for what is the use of simply sitting and planning, of contemplating the very nature of one’s existence, of the why and what-if? There is more than that, and we are the steppes. We are the Variags and we do not bow before anyone. ]]

LINDON_START_BODY = [[In ill-fated Beleriand, amongst the Laiquendi, began the history of the Haven of Lindon, Land of the Singers. As the War of Wrath enveloped Beleriand, Círdan the Shipwright gathered the survivors he had gifted with sanctuary upon the island of Balar. The swan ships bore them to the only surviving piece of Beleriand, that which became the Havens of Lindon, built by Ereinion Gil-galad, High King of the Ñoldor in exile. Nestled south of the Blue Mountains, below shattered Nogrod, the Teleri fostered the Ñoldor and their own kin within a Haven, a safe place for the beleaguered, whose lives had been broken by the terrible war whose aftermath saw an entire land sink below the Belegaer Sea.\n\nIn the Second Age, there were two Kingdoms of Ñoldor – that of Lindon and that of Eregion – known to many as Hollin, friend to the Dwarves - where the Rings of Power were made. Eregion did not last, but Lindon survived and most of the Ñoldor to remain upon Middle-earth now dwell within Lindon, alongside the Teleri, all under the leadership of Círdan. Whilst Elrond claimed the Kingship from the fallen Gil-galad, slain in the wars of the Last Alliance of Men and Elves. Círdan is the Lord of the Teleri still, and his hand bore the Ring Narya until he gifted it to Gandalf upon his arrival from Aman, to aid his efforts on behalf of the Valar – testament to his belief and wisdom in hope and the Valar.\n\nThe Havens of Mithlond, as they are known, stand separated by the Gulf of Lune - into Forlindon to the north and Harlindon to the south, whilst Mithlond, itself, stands at the mouth of the River Lhûn. The beauty of Mithlond is immediately apparent in the white arches that cover all walkways between houses, the city is split between two parts, each of the side of the Lhûn River, a natural canal, straddled by beautiful white buildings on levels that sparkle with reflections of the sea. Here are the Swan Ships, a legacy of Beleriand, of Earendil’s journey – he who sailed to the Undying Lands to bring the Valar to war, of Alqualonde, the greatest port and most beauteous of settlements in the Undying lands. During this Age, the Third of the Sun and Moon, they bear away the strength of Elves, who shall never return.\n\nThe White Towers stand some distance from the cities, encroaching on the Shire, which wonders at their significance, and a visible reminder of the grace of the Ñoldor. Here is one of the palantír, the Seeing Stones, where Círdan follows his longing and views only the Undying Lands to which many Elves leave these shores, but which he does not. Perhaps it is comfort, perhaps grief that drives him to see the lands of the Valar and the Vanyar – those also of the Teleri and Ñoldor that dwell there, and the ones that return there in trickles of graceful sadness. Círdan built these towers to honour the kingdom of Arnor, when it was at its most glorious.\n\nTrade here drifts in from the farther communities – even Dwarves trade with the Elves here in small kind. The Swan ships bring goods from friends along the coasts, up through the Gulf of Lhûn and into Mithlond. The Shire brings more economic growth and sustains them as if it were the breadbasket of Middle-earth. From the ruins of Arnor and distant Imladris come more rarities and Dúnedain visit occasionally, with tales of distant events. Elrond meanwhile has an army of the Eldar; Ñoldor of old, led by the lords Elladan, Elrohir and Glorfindel, ‘Lord of the House of Golden Flower’ of Gondolin. Glorfindel is the only living being to have been ‘brought back’ from the Halls of Mandos, and slew a Balrog single-handedly, albeit to his own ruin. Sent back with the Istari, he is a testament to eras past but for the time being he is away and we know not when he will return. Elrond’s forces are great warriors of vastly superior skill in battle.

It will not be an easy task to win this war, but Imladris has the power to do so, even within the limits it so clearly exhibits. Likewise, Círdan knows that war will come to Elves, and that his likely future is to send his troops to a war they are perhaps ill-suited to, given their lack of numbers. His armies are based around the modern ways of Elven military, of speed and grace, but are also a testament to the strength of the Eldar who fought in the early wars of the Second Age. As ever before, their power unleashed will be both a grace to Middle-earth, and a terrifying woe to their enemies, for the Elves retain much of their former majesty in war. In the past, flowers bloomed where their lords walked, and the fire of Valinor in their eyes burned the Orcs with the purity of righteous fury. The wonder and strength of the Ñoldor remains untested, but this will not last. Yet still they will fight, for some have not forgotten Middle-earth yet. ]]

There is little strength left in Gondor or their puppets Dol Amroth. Long in preparation have we been, and our legions will pound upon the great gate of Minas Tirith. Our list of allies grows with every passing day and when Minas Tirith falls to us, Gondor will fall; bringing all of the West to their knees!\n\nThe Black Gate will be our starting point but where shall we send our hordes? North to aid Khamûl, west to take the overstretched garrisons at Cair Andros or south to come at Gondor from the lands of Ithilien and Harondor. All is in your hands, my Lord, and your power is unfettered at last. The Human servants in the East and the Haradrim in the South will draw upon them the ending of all, yet are capricious in their loyalty, and remain an inconsistent threat. Will you let them run free or beat them to your tune of the Way of Pain? Your true plans are yours only, and we will follow the hosts as you wish. Your followers fear you greatly and this gives us unimaginable power; they will strike under a pall of darkness, irresistible and unbeatable.\n\nMount Doom is active once more, a show of Mordor’s strength to make them fear us, spreading uncertainty in our foe – a clear show of our strength, even as you confine the palantír to show them what you wish. We would see you in physical form once more, despite the great power of your Will alone; the One Ring we will find and you will be complete. We see our servants’ thoughts revealed, My Lord, and report as our penetrations of their minds will drive them to spite and terror.\n\nThe Great Eye sees all, its fiery vision lancing through our wondrous pall of darkness, and its screaming Nazgûl bring fear and terror wherever they go – where the iron-shod foot, fist and the terrible lash would fail, His will lies like bonds of mannish steel. He binds the likes of Gothmog and His Mouthpiece, Black Númenóreans, equal or better than the ones that send the little Orcs squealing into grubby little burrows. Where on this vile, light-covered fool of a weak ‘West’ is his equal? Even the Saruman creature, the self-styled White Wizard cannot dare to match the Dark Lord.\n\nOur god is kind to us, bringing Darkness and wondrous stench to cover the foulness of the air beyond Mordor, to give us sanctuary in our pits, dug deep enough to cleanse and sustain, where we sacrifice the weakest and eat our brethren that are disgusting, pathetic enough to rightfully die squealing.\n\nThis, my Lord, is how we see your greatness, the rising scream of the Nine, the power that drives the terrible Olog-hai and the Uruk-hai. We Uruk-hai, the fighting Uruks, tower over this vast land, the furnaces amongst the fires of Orodruin that reveals and contains your power in its glory. The decay of the foul plants succour us, the delicious drive of fear makes us hate well enough to pleasure in the extermination of all that defies Your will.\n\nFew we fear. Those that call us Yrch, their spiteful halo of light, their stupidity of ‘wisdom’ as they call it; these Elves. They fight well, and the fire of the cursed Valar in their eyes burns us terribly, but they lack power, for they defy nothing. They are weak next to You, my god, my Giver, my terrifying, swamping shroud of PAIN! This terrible pain makes theirs lessen and it is far sweeter in your Shadow. Truly you named our lands, and Udûn we know under old tales, in a different place, but still a place of Flame and Shadow. Give us our dark day, and we will sweep across Gondor, burning, slaying, smiting; we will slaughter all, and the Uruk-hai will sing their war-songs for Your glory. In Dol Guldur will our wrath descend upon the Elves; in the East, your worshipping man-flesh will destroy the Dwarves, the stunted Naugrim. From Carn-Dum, Angmar of old, the wondrous Dark will slaughter the pig-flesh of the Dúnedain, Riven-dell will burn, their trees will be cut down and the blanket of night will cover all Middle-earth. Your Orcs will spit that curse through a veil of blood, our black iron will sever heads, fall upon Minas Tirith, grot and filth, all! Your will shall send us wherever you wish, but our wish is to bask under the Eye, to feel the pain and inflict true suffering on this ‘West’. Yes, the Nazgûl whisper and hiss of war, long in planning, long in coming, and nothing can stand against us, for they are divided, and by division they shall fall.\n\n"Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, nash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul." ]]

The rest of the mountains are ours and no filthy bearded Dwarf or sneaky Elf better say otherwise. We hold all of the passes over the mountains.

They war upon us openly now, they hope to cower us into retreat, but they underestimate our strength and do not realise the futility of their efforts, we will find their secret lairs and burn them.\n\nOur enemies are many, but they are far from united. We are safe in our tunnels, save from the Dwarves, whom we do fear still. Only they can truly threaten us, but they are few in number, lost amongst many lands. We have the Shadow and Flame as an ally, and a powerful ally it is. Moria is its realm now, yet it accepts our presence. You were wise to treaty with such a power my chief, its might is unmatched; no one who dares enter the black pit will escape with their lives.\n\nWe will have vengeance on our enemies. Our blades will seek them out and we will brand them with our names and those of the Eye, will slake our weapons in their lifeless corpses, in their slack-eyed deaths we will find recompense for their atrocities. We are the Goblin-folk, the rulers of the Misty Mountains: Our folk are united once more under your leadership, my Chief, and we will rise to a glory unseen since Azog’s rule, you have the blood of Bolg in your veins and will lead us to victory. We are prepared, we are hungry, and we are eager to bring blade and fury upon our foes. ]]

RHUN_START_BODY = [[Once, this land was ruled by dragons! Huge, powerful, fire breathing dragons. Those days are, sadly, gone. With the death of Smaug the Magnificent, there is but one dragon left in all of Middle-earth. The Golden Dragon of Rhûn! Ruled by the most powerful Khan in the West, Lôke-Khan Rhükar. The wealthy city state of Mistrand is the dragon's lair. Mistrand translates to "golden hill or mound" in the Rhûnnic dialect. Thus, the dragon sleeps atop his horde.\n\nRhûn is an absolutely gigantic region. The Sea of Rhûn only marking the very Western most edge of this mighty amalgamation of confederated city states and steppe clans. While the East of Rhûn is largely controlled by a single Khan the Western half of the Rhûnnic territory has been in utter chaos and upheaval ever since the defeat we suffered at the hands of Eärnil in the lands known as Ithilien and the Dead Marshes. It has taken millenia for Rhûn to recover from that battle. Finally, with the assistance of the Great Eye in Mordor, we are prepared to storm across the plains of Rhovonian once again!\n\nWe are closely allied to the Lôke-Khan Ja Sür of the East. He will aid us if he can. However, there are several clans in the region who have sprung up in the power void our ancestors left behind. They will need to be crushed and completely subjugated. We can't attack our real enemies in Rhovonian until we secure our heartlands.\n\nTo our West lies the heart of Balchoth territory at Bûrh Ermanarikis. These men are fierce opponents, what they lack in equipment and numbers they make up for in ingenuity. They craft sturdy javelins and you do not want to be on the receiving end of one of their volleys. Their skirmishing skills would be invaluable to us.\n\nAlso to the West at Lest is a conclave of the Udege clan who have been sailing the Great Lake, and its rivers, since before they could walk. They have sworn no allegiance to Sauron or his enemies but if we hope to bring ruin down on the Northmen then the Celduin is the fastest way there and we will need the Udege's boats!\n\nTo the North East lie the lands of the Arulad clansmen. Skilled in both infantry and cavalry based warfare they will help fill our ranks with both front line troops and light cavalry.\n\nTo our South and South East lie two independent Variag Khans. They aren't particularly powerful, but our ally Khan Arkísh further to the South has requested our assistance against them as they have broken their treaty with him and started raiding his lands. If we take them both out, Khan Arkísh will reward us with both gold and access to some of his warriors.\n\nFar to the east lies a loose confederation of tribes know as the Süri'ut. They have not joined with Sauron and instead they seek a more peaceful existence. However they have managed to perfect a chariot making process that even the Wainriders could not do! Their current leader, Lôke-Khan Ja Sür, has a taste for battle his predecessor did not. However his people respond to strength and he believes he can rally them to fight with us if we can first show our might; unite our clans and claim the heartlands of Dorwinion! With his and the Dark Lord's support we would then be ready to seek our vengeance upon the peoples of Middle-earth! ]]

ROHAN_START_BODY = [[Eorlingas, we. The Éothéod.... Riders of the Riddermark, of the Westfold, the Eastfold, of Snowbourn, the Wold.... of many places we come, and in times of war, our riders make the ground shake as we issue a mighty roar as of one voice. As friends, we are constant, as foes we are dire and deadly. Proud, our Horse-Lords, and that pride stands strong in the lands we were gifted by Cirion of Gondor, famed Steward of the Kings of the Southern Kingdom of Númenóreans, a race of man that we were allies with long before they entered Beleriand and became so mighty. Alas, his House in no more, but Eorl gave his oath, and we ride for them when the beacons are lit, when the Red Arrow comes.\n\nOur lands are as of a Sea of Grass, a vast rolling plain that runs from the River Adorn and River Isen in the West, to the Mering Stream in the East, beyond which lies Gondor. It is a land that suits our ways well, for we breed the greatest horses of all, kings of which are the Mearas. Beauteous creatures are horses, and we are their greatest Lords, save those of the Mearas, who are akin to lords of ours. Calenardhon, our land was called, and it was claimed through no right by the savage and uncouth men of Dunland, who could not even speak the tongues of men. We have warred with them before, and will again, but they are not a threat to us – unaided, we ride over them like a horse through a brook. If ever they were to gain strength of others, we may be at risk, but we think not still. Perhaps they covet our horses, for we are strong in trade and in war, and they are not.\n\nEorl was one of the greatest lords, but Helm Hammerhand was to come from his issue, and he was a mighty warrior of old – once compared to a Troll in his ferocity! He forged the safety of Rohan in his claim on our greatest refuge, a place where Rohan can gather its people in times of strife – Helm’s Deep, the fortress guarded by the Deeping Wall – a dike that would take a foe beyond normal means to overcome! Here lies the Hornburg – here is the very horn of Helm himself. Many times have our warriors fought in this great refuge, and never has an enemy claimed it as theirs. Helm built it well, and the Deeping wall holds no weaknesses for an enemy to exploit. Here lies his great horn, and in times of war, its signal is one of valour, to remind the Riddermark to never give to our foes.\n\nThe line of Helm was at last lost, and his nephew Frealaf took the hand of Kingship. There was war with Dunland then, and Wulf son of Freca, of mixed, cursed blood was able to besiege us until our allies came from Gondor and our people in the hallowed lands of Dunharrow, where the ghosts dwell for sure. Even as the Kings blood would seem to run thin have we a king like Theoden who if all goes well will make a greater king than his father Thengel. Rohan is on the rise, never weakened, never lost, and we are as numerous as of old, whilst our allies in Gondor await each assault of the enemy with less will and greater fear. We await the call to war, and will answer, as we have done before.\n\nLong have we kept to the words, the Oath of Eorl. King Folcwine lost his sons, Fastred and Folcred, at the battle of Poros Crossing, for the aid of Gondor as we have ever done. Many times have we answered their call, but they, in turn have answered ours. Will we or they, once more, be asked to come to aid the one or the other? For war is brewing. It is in the air, and we call our warriors to readiness, the trained Éothéod are ready for war. Long has this been in coming, and long will it be 'ere it is done with. Our great trade and our swift riders place us in a position of great strength, but our standing army is not so; never as strong as it could be, and the Éothéod are oft long in their coming. We begin now, otherwise we may be too late; swiftly we must act, and none can lead our armies or guard us, as you, my most beloved of the lords and leaders of men. We await the call to war, and will answer, as we have ever done before. ]]

In the days of old we fought under the banner of Melkor himself: it was we who stood against the firstborn; we who fought to the last on the fields of Anfauglith and Lothlann and; we who fought countless skirmishes against the Dwarves of Nogrod, our hated enemies. When the traitors came and drowned our homeland, we survived the fall: fleeing the destruction and finding our way to the frozen north. There we endured for millenia: honing our skill and growing strong in the biting winds. In time, our people multiplied, our warrior ranks grew and our army longed for vengeance against the Dwarves and Firstborn. The Second Age past, the Third Age grew old and only in the waning years did we return. Our lesser kin of the Misty Mountains had sent word to us of a great Dwarven host that was purging the mountains; it was then that we stepped into the pages of history once more. The War of the Dwarves and Orcs presented the perfect opportunity to strike but we had not fought the Dwarves since the elder days. We waited and watched and saw our kin utterly obliterated by our oldest foe. Some of our number joined with the Goblins and fought at Gundabad to gauge the scum's power and it became clear that we would not want to step in the path of the Dwarven juggernaut just yet. However, fortune smiled on us only a few short years after the final battle at Azanulbizar. The Dwarves abandoned Gundabad and the Goblins did not have the numbers to reclaim it. It was then that we came out of the north: as a great wind; swift and merciless. We claimed the great mountain for our own and here we have waited for our moment to finally crush Aulë's mistake.\n\nYears have passed and we have watched Middle-earth as nations have waxed and waned. Preparing our forces for the final strike. However, not two days passed, Sauron's messenger came to us. A black rider approached the mountain from the south and passed by our gate guards as though they were flowers in the tundra. His gravelly voice spoke of a great war to come and a time when the children of Melkor would rule this land. He commanded that we finally break from our isolation and attack the Dwarves in Erebor. The council of chieftains has now discussed this action and we agree. The time has come Warlord. Let the north tremble! Let the very mountains break at the sound of our warcries! Let the mistakes learn that their bitterest foes, from the depths of time, have returned! As we march, so shall winter spread from the Great Mountain and cover all the lands in our frozen grasp. In Melkor's name: the Snow-orcs have come! ]]

SHADOW_START_BODY = [[Once the Elves claimed this land, the Greenwood, but our Master came here after the disaster at Dagorlad, after the Siege of Barad-dûr where He lost the One Ring, and his physical form gave over to the spirit that became the ‘Necromancer’ to the fools of the White Council. We are strong, yes, yet as if one of us, the Nine could ever match His presence. Long they overestimated their so-called wisdom, and long our Lord deceived them. It was called the Amon Lanc, the ‘Bald Hill’ – why call something a fool’s name? Had they run out of imagination? It is something they seem to lack, something our Master has oft exploited. So trusting, the Elven-Smiths. How He worked upon them, bending them to his Design, as He had in Númenor, as He did here, in Dol Guldur, the Hill of Sorcery – a fine name for a fitting design. A bastion of pits and high walls, seen even from far Lórien. A reminder of what they most fear.\n\nThe fools did not see, they did not believe he had survived, let alone that he was regaining his physical form here, under the strongest of sorceries, that only He has at his command. We Nazgûl aided his deception, and we oft moved Him to Mordor as it was, shattered after this Last Alliance, broken. But it is broken no longer, and power remains in Dol Guldur as well – for it never left here. Their small victory has led to complacency, something to exploit, as we already do!\n\nRather than face our strength, the Elf-children of Oropher, who died so nicely upon our blades, fell back to Eryn Galen, in the north of our glorious Taur-nu-Fuin. Echoes of the past ages in that name, a tribute to our god Melkor, of the Shadow’s vice in old Beleriand. That and of our Lord in his Tower of Werewolves, where the original ‘Forest of Fear’ came to be known. There is something savagely joyous in the Elves naming of our realms and strongholds...so much delicious fear therein. We revel in it, for fear is our greatest asset. That and a sly tongue.\n\nFew know that He came here with a darker purpose, one more practical than simple terror. We knew where the One Ring was lost, for it was us that sent the forces to the Gladden Fields, there that we drew the little ones from their Mountains and slew the one that maimed our Lord, this Isildur, who succumbed to the One’s desires. Mark me in this, they all do in the end! Men are so weak; less so, the Dwarves or Elves – we had to take the Seven from the Naugrim, the last being the singularly satisfying torture of the fool King Thrór. Sadly, his demise seemed to be what revealed our design to this ‘White Council’ as the Istari discovered our secret. It took them longer than we anticipated, and they were remarkably slow in acting, but they took our stronghold. They failed to take we of the Nine, nor our Master’s life; he tricked them once again, and he returned as the Great Eye, the one who is Fear, is Terror, is inspiration to us all - our driving force!\n\nWe will show how pointless their petty wars are, for we have reoccupied Dol Guldur, led by Khamûl, our Second, and will launch a glorious war from here, for the Great Eye has re-built the fortress of Barad-dûr, that the Orcs call Lugbúrz, in our language of dominance, the Black Speech of Mordor. Even the Elves and the Istari fear to utter words in the tongue of dominion. From Dol Guldur, we search once again for the One Ring, and we can assault the Elves with precipitate ease – Lórien will burn, as will the north-woods of Mirkwood; this fool ‘Haven’ of the Son of Oropher, Thranduil – we slew his father, and so we will him. The Nine will launch war upon Middle-earth, and our striking hammer will come from many places, but not least of all the Tower of Sorcery: to shatter the Elves, perhaps to aid the assault or subjugation of the new Kingdom at the Lonely Mountain – a sly tongue is a quicker end; perhaps to sack Dale and aid our subjects from the East, or turn to ravage other lands, slaughter and give no mercy - as is our way. We will launch fear and a lightning war that will sweep the flotsam of the West away, even as the White Council stands powerless and betrayed. ]]

SHIRE_START_BODY = [[Once was the Kingdom of Arnor. Long was its decline and longer still its eventual fall. Of all of Arnor, only two areas survived: the Shire of the Hobbit-folk and the men and Hobbits of Bree-land. There was a long history of both lands, but much was recorded of Hobbits, and little account was given to Bree. For the Men and Hobbits, the thought of war was abhorrent, but war is coming nonetheless. Storm clouds gather on the horizon, and the rain that follows may yet wash away these idiosyncratic lands of strange and naive folk, the protectorate of the last of the Dúnedain.\n\nBree-land consists of four main settlements, all catering for men and Hobbits alike. They were part of the Kingdom of Arnor, but seem to have thrived despite the loss of fair Cardolan, foul Rhudaur and the eventual fall of grand Arthedain. Around the Bree-hill lie the town of Bree itself, populated by both men and Hobbits, positioned on the main road from Lindon to Imladris. Three other towns exist, based around the large hill. On the south-eastern side lies Staddle, where Hobbits grow pipe-weed ; on the borders of the Chetwood lies Combe and to the north of the hill lies Archet, another town of mixed-populace.\n\nIn the past, Bree-land was a major community in the Realm of Arnor, but when the Dúnedain failed, so did the eminency of Bree. Despite any authority to protect it, Bree prospered still, and neither fell into decay nor suffered a fate such as that of the rest of Arnor. Trade is their main power in this Middle-earth, and their military is not as strong as other kingdoms, but they have forces that will fight, and have some protection from the distant and mysterious Rangers of the North.\n\nThe Shire is a warm and welcome land, where orchards grace the hills, Hobbits burrow their homes into the earth and the fields lay in mix of crop and fallow, a system cleverly worked to give the most fruitful harvests. Pipe –Weed is grown here too, a weed that is smoked by men and Dwarves, making its way even to the farther south, where it is a delicacy. Many brands exist, and Old Toby is one of the greats, as is Longbottom Leaf. Only a smoker of pipe-weed can tell you its wonders. Others simply do not understand.\n\nThe Shire, called Sûza in Westron, is made of four Farthings; within which are the familial lands of Tuckborough and Buckland, honorifics for the two notorious families that dominated the regions. To be ‘Tookish’ was to be bawdy and adventurous – each family had its own characteristics, and there were many including the Proudfoots, the Gamgees and others. All were full of whimsy, based around the Brandywine River – or Baranduin - and Old Forest, through the more settled and rural Farthings, where the less that went on the better for it.\n\nThe Shire is not suited for war, although they sent Hobbit archers, who were uncommonly good shots, to aid the Kings of Arnor, but have grown far less warlike as their times of Idyll went on. Can such a land be bent to the perils of war? Will Bree defend its borders with strength during these terrible times of unrest? Only time will tell. They are of importance to all, being the breadbasket of Western Middle-earth, trading beneficially with all lands west of the Misty Mountains. They are sheltered strongly, but will still have a part to play. What choices will you make with this odd land, in this war of wars? ]]

THRANDUIL_START_BODY = [[Doriath, the Hidden Kingdom, was the greatest of the Sindarin realms in Beleriand. For many long years, it flourished under the rule of Elu Thingol and Melian his queen, but during the Wars of Beleriand it was destroyed, sacked first by treacherous Dwarves and later by the jealous Sons of Fëanor. Many of those who survived the fall of the realm fled east past the towering peaks of the Hithaeglir into lands where we, the Tawarwaith -- Silvan Elves long sundered from the Elves of Beleriand -- dwelled.\n\nBeing a rustic people lesser in wisdom than the Sindar, we accepted them as our lords. Under the guidance of Amdír and Oropher, the realms of Lindórinand and Eryn Lasgalen were established, and for many years we lived in peace. Peace, however, was not to last, for the rising power of Mordor forced us and our Sindarin princes to take up arms. During the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, Amdír and Oropher, along with their sons Amroth and Thranduil, heeded the call of Gil-galad and led great hosts to battle. Sauron was defeated, but at great cost -- both Amdír and Oropher were slain, along with most of their armies.\n\nHis heart filled with disquiet and disillusionment, Thranduil, Oropher's son, led us northward, where he consolidated the Woodland Realm and delved an underground fortress in the style of Menegroth in Doriath. However in the southern reaches of the newly named 'Mirkwood Forest', the ever present shadow began to grow stronger and stronger. The white council sought to cleanse the old fortress of Dol Guldur but despite their success, evil has once again returned and now Sauron has openly proclaimed war on any who seek to lead free lives.\n\nWhile the Woodland Realm may be ill-equipped in arms and armour when compared to our western kin, we are hardy and valiant warriors whose skill with the bow is unmatched and whose hatred of Sauron runs deep. In the shadows of the forest our wariors can bring down any foe with swift silence but we have yet to fight openly on the plains of Gorgoroth, Dagorlad and the Brown Lands.\n\nWe must also ask ourselves, should we leave the Dwarves of Erebor, the bitter, dour Naugrim, and the Men of Dale, long our friends, to their own defence? Should we abandon the land of Dorwinion to watch its vineyards burn, and concentrate on the possible unification of our forces with those of Celeborn and Galadriel? Do we face Dol Guldur, or even turn to the Ered Mithrin, the Grey Mountains, to force back the Orcs and Goblin-folk of the Misty Mountains?\n\nOur allies seem few, and far away, beset by their own concerns, and our position unenviable, but we shall not abandon Middle-earth! We will strike like vengeful shadows to lure and annihilate our foes for good. To see the lands of Mirkwood unite oncemore, is that an impossible dream, after all these years? Perhaps, but it is a good thought, My Lord, and even a slim possibility is a possibility none-the-less. Only time will tell if we tree folk can rally to become a force of power or if we will stay skulking in the shadows, trapped like fish in a barrel. ]]

UMBAR_START_BODY = [[The ‘Golden One’, Ar-Pharazôn sailed, with many of our ancestors to make war on Valinor; he was smote by the false gods that sit in that land, and our home of Númenor was cast beneath the waves. From that point on, the people of Númenor were divided between the surviving King’s Men, loyal to Ar-Pharazôn, who had stayed in Númenor’s colonies in the south of Middle-earth and so had escaped the ruin, and the treacherous Faithful who fled the isle to found kingdoms among the Firstborn. We are the descendants of those King’s Men, the Ar-Adûnâim, and our name means the King’s Númenoreans in the tongue of mother Númenor, Adûnaic. We have heard of weakness in Middle-earth and sail forth from our lands to claim land for King and country.\n\nWe have gathered from the many cities of our kind that lay to the uncharted south of lands of the Faithful, into a mighty host. We come from provinces as close as Bellakar that lie close to Umbar, or lands as far south as vast jungles, and even further where mountains reach to clasp the sky. Lands such as the Bay of Gan, the Gulf of Rain, Tûr Betark, the Dark Forests of the South and the Bay of Ûsakan. All bow down to a new lord, who shall lead us to the north, to our birthright. A new king, who we hope can be a new Ar-Pharazôn and restore the rule of Númenor.\n\nFor many years we have fought and squabbled among ourselves, seeking only the riches and gold of each other. Petty Kingdoms and Great Cities alike burnt each other’s crops and looted each other’s vassals. Once we had been united a Númenóreans all but that unity splintered when the Great Betrayer Sauron led the Golden One astray down the path of ruin. With the ruin of Númenor, its great colonies fractured as their lords, man and woman alike, sought to claim the crown. Alas, little but blood and ruin came of those attempts and after many years the kingdoms realized there would be little chance of a leader with a strong claim emerging, and so, agreed to an uneasy truce, each tolerating the sovereignty of the others.\n\nThere was once a chance of unity, when the Faithful King, Tarannon Falastur sought to parley with us. The many nations acted as one and we sent a noble lady, Berúthiel, who held the closest ties that could be found to the Golden One, in an attempt to place a King’s Woman on the throne of a united New Númenor, for she would control the weak King and operate as the power behind the throne. Sadly, the plans were ruined by a meddling Steward and the union of the lands never came to pass; and so, Berúthiel was exiled. Ironically, she returned bearing the child of the King. By exiling her, Tarannon Falastur had guaranteed that he would never have an heir. Although one named Castamir would later claim the throne as a Black Númenorean, he had little relation to us, and was only a fool of Gondor that used our name without knowing its true meaning.\n\nAlmost two thousand years passed before we would be united under a single purpose again; a young lord named Gimilkhâd came before the annual council of the splintered colonies of Númenor, and claimed he was directly descended from Berúthiel and therefore had not only a claim to the throne of Númenor, due to blood ties with the Golden One, but also the throne of Gondor. Few believed his claim at first, but he produced documents and an ancient ring that proved his bloodline, and showed the same skill with cats that Berúthiel was said to have. He then announced that if we would grant him the throne, he would lead us to great glory in the north, and we would have Middle-earth under our dominion and we would form a New Númenor. Although some resisted, most joined him, and so we assembled a mighty host and set sail north.\n\nNow, we have arrived, on the shores of the lands of the Faithful, and we stand to await your order, my King. None know of our coming, and so we can act as we wish to; four chief foes await us. The Elves are pawns of the Valar and will resist us at all costs, and likewise the Dwarves, caring only for their greed, will seek to deny us tribute so both must be crushed under our heel. The Great Betrayer also skulks in the Land of Shadow, Mordor, and so he must be brought to justice before the throne for his crimes of high-treason against the Golden One. Finally, the ruling houses of Gondor and Dol Amroth, must be extinguished and their lands subjugated, and any who claims throne of the Faithful must be made to pay with their blood for their hearsay, for there is only one true heir, and that is you. I am also pleased to say the Kingdom of Arnor lies in ruins and cannot threaten you as its foe, the Witch-king, destroyed it long ago. How you deal with them is up to you, you can ally with one against the others, or simply crush them all in one fell blow.\n\nFinally, I am pleased to inform you that you will be able to recruit any troops from any Human nation to our banner for our officers are well experienced in commanding men of different nations. Furthermore, the seed of discontent still lies ripe in the hearts of many in Gondor and with gentle persuasion and proof of our power many there will join with us. May I suggest we begin our conquest at Umbar, for the conquest of the great Númenórean port would prove to be a symbol of our might, and recently, a Gondor army led by a man named Thorongil sacked the city, and now only rebels of Gondor and Harad roam it, and it will be an easy conquest. It is now the Return of the True King! ]]

EREGION_START_BODY = [[The First House of the Ñoldor rose from the ashes. We are being led by our prince Maernil son of Celebrimbor who vowed to avenge treacherous Sauron for his father's death. In 2920 T.A. Prince Maernil decided to reclaim his home and went to Eregion with a great host of elves. There were found goblins of the Misty Mountains in large numbers. The main battle ended with the victory of the Ñoldor. Clearing Eregion, rebuilding Ost-in-Edhil and resettlement of our people lasted for 90 years. Now everything is done and we've almost cleared our ancient homeland from orcish scum and their wolves and rebuilt our lost city at last. During the reconstruction Maernil and his builders found and opened a secret ancient treasury of Celebrimbor, where he hid many precious things, folios with knowledge and technologies of Gwaith-i-Mirdain. We erected tall walls and stocked much food and supplies. The Realm of Eregion will be restored. We're going to show Middle-earth what we're worth. But we're surrounded by enemies for the time being - Elrond's concerns are elsewhere as of this day. Círdan sees great danger from the south, and foretells of the doom written in the stars on the finest clear nights. We will not see much help from them, but it's no wonder. We must do everything alone as we have done before. We must stand against all threats but the most immediate lies in the Misty Mountains, the centre of elven concerns for many years. Evil mobilizes, My Prince, and Eregion must be prepared! \n\nOst-in-Edhil is the great city of the Ñoldor where the Great Rings were forged. This province belongs to Maernil, a high prince of Eregion, and a potential bearer of the title "The High King of the Ñoldor". Ost-in-Edhil was established by the Ñoldor during the early parts of the Second Age, located where the Sirannon met the Glanduin. A large road was erected to the West Gate of Khazad-dûm under the shadow of the Misty Mountains, to facilitate communication and trade between the Dwarves and the Elves. This road can be erected again when we capture Moria and cleanse it of orcs.\n\nEregion's exiles have seen many battles in many wars, always defending to ensure the survival of The First House. Their new homeland has been the forests of Southern Lindon at the foots of Southern Ered Luin and Bay of Galen. They called it Hirneryn(Lord's Grove). Ost-en-Ñoldor was the new capital of the survivors of Eregion and the residence of Prince Maernil. It was a peaceful and quiet place, where the elves could recover their wounds and grow in strength. In the Second Age Hirneryn traded with Númenor: perfectly crafted armour and weapons sold for mithrill and gold. In 1680 T.A. an army of Hirneryn stopped the forces of Angmar and exterminated all of them who dared to come close to Talath Dirnen.\n\nElrond and Cirdan are the chief rulers of other High Elves. They are our main allies. Elrond and Maernil have a long history together. They fought against forces of Sauron in two wars. The relationship between Eregion and Imladris will be crucial to its developing story, as it faces numerous foes, and it’s list of allies grows short.\n\nMaernil has an army of the Ñoldor led by his son Ecthellion. In the future, lord of Gwaith-i-Mirdain Dornornoston and lord-protector of the Moon Temple Tiliondil may join us if you construct Gwaith-i-Mirdain guild in Ost-in-Edhil and the Moon Temple in Mithlond. Maernil’s forces are the deadliest warriors of vastly superior skill in battle. To this end, Eregion will play a major part in the war which surely follows, but is limited in strength of numbers and cannot easily rectify any mistakes made early in the war.\n\nApart from Imladris Ost-in-Edhil is an essential centre of elven culture and trade. Maernil’s realm is a shield for Elrond against the orcs of Moria, where they are being gathered in great numbers as well as wildmen of Dunland. We must find reliable allies for the war that will soon engulf Middle-earth, as, although our armies are of the best, only with a strong economy and stronger allies can we achieve victory.\n\nI would advise you to conquer West Moria as soon as possible, because this is the centre of spawning of Misty Mountains orcs. Middle-earth is divided and Eregion stands at the crossroads of all lands in the West. We have an ideal location for dominion during this cataclysmic era, but must in turn stand in the way of danger from two directions – Moria to the east, the Dunlendings to the south and countless others, who all see the conquest of Eregion as vital to their own war efforts. It will not be an easy task to win this war, but Eregion has the power to do so, even within the limits it so clearly exhibits. ]]

AMROTH_EXPAND_BODY = [[The wings of the Silver Swan have spread far and the power of Dol Amroth has become great, rivalling that of the heights of its protector! Ships of the swan are seen all about the southern ocean and the ground shakes as the hooves of the famous knights sweep away all those who oppose the Prince of Dol Amroth. Their soldiers fight with a fervour that is scarcely seen in the bleak lands of Gondor and now more than ever is it apparent that they are descended of Elves and men. The banners of the swan are now a common sight and spread fear and doubt amongst those who would fight against them. The song of Amroth and Nimrodel has become the most feared war cry of the south - 'The wind was in his flowing hair, the foam about him shone; afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan.'

ANGMAR_DIMINISH_BODY = [[Angmar's Iron reach has frozen in place, and the ice-ridden claws are blunting at last. The Orcs die in their hundreds, and the strength and dark majesty it once revelled in belies the malice that drives that force. Its resources run thin and the chill air seems warmer today.

BLUEDWARVES_DIMINISH_BODY = [[It seemed, for a short while, that the ancient glories of Ered Luin could be stoked from dying embers, that dire vengeance would be enacted upon the Goblin-kind. Now even that seems in the distant past, as the Dwarves of Ered Luin stand on the edge of disaster and into the dim light, they see visions of woe. Yet their tale does not end here; nothing is yet purely defined by Fate, and they may surprise those who see their victory thus far as final. One small pebble of hope can start a landslide of change. ]]

BLUEDWARVES_EXPAND_BODY = [[Long has the once-great collection of Dwarves of Ered Luin simply been bound by memories of a distant past, of glories uncounted and the greatest smiths to have lived. Now, it seems that the forges ring true, that Dwarves are standing upon the edge of glory once more and that the power of vengeance is hotter than any smith's fire could ever be. Under the guidance of the newly named clan leader, after the flight of Thorin, the Dwarves have prospered and sent the hammers of vengeance out to cast down their enemies. Even the Elves of Mithlond are wary of this newfound power in the West. ]]

DALE_DIMINISH_BODY = [[The devastation of Smaug, although just a distant memory, has been realised tenfold on the lands of Dale. Their cities lie burning, their armies no more than small bands of roaming survivors and their women and children slain by the thousands. The banks of the Celduin no longer enjoy the sounds of laughter and merriment they now play host to the crackle of flame. Where men would come to rest and children to play, is now no more than a watery grave. The city of Dale has diminished the famed bows of its warriors will sing no longer. ]]
DALE_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Dale wains ]]
DALE_EXPAND_BODY = [[Shafts of arrows litter the lands of Rhovanion, trumpets can be heard ringing across the plains and banners wave high on the hills as the hatred for evil leads the men of Dale on toward unbelievable conquest! The defence of their homeland that was a first just a spark has caught alight into a great flame and the armies of Dale and the lake seem unrelenting as they pursue those who stand against them. Marching ever onward, their force seems unstoppable and those foolish enough to oppose them lay dead with the memory of a thousand whistling arrows on their lips. It seems nothing can stop their expansion! ]]
DALE_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Dale prospers ]]
DORWINION_DIMINISH_BODY = [[The finest Vineyards in all of Middle-earth burn, a candle of the world is being stifled, as is the glorious song of the Elves brought to silence and death. Grim is the decline of this fair joy that shone amongst such ruinous decay, succumbing to the Shadow that plagues the West. Many lie dead in their fields and whispers of decay shroud the beauty of such a light in the blackest night. ]]
DORWINION_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Dorwinion in Decline ]]
DORWINION_EXPAND_BODY = [[The Land of Wine and Song is rising. The Elves look upon them with favour, and their allies have pulled them to their sides with unwanted splendour and resolve.

Wonder and joy are born once more under the dim shadow that ate at its very borders. ]]
DORWINION_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Dorwinion Resplendent ]]
DUNEDAIN_DIMINISH_BODY = [[The Blood of Númenor has been bled under the stars. Cloaks are torn, armour rent and perhaps the Dúnedain held true wisdom in their detachment. It is a sad day that the blood Númenor is becoming spent, when cloaks are soaked in blood and their allies begin to question themselves. The effect of this sadness will fester and see the ruin of the Dúnedains' Remnant Kingdoms of old. Allies must move to save them, whilst their foes must finish them to gain safety against such a deep will. ]]
DUNEDAIN_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Decline of the Rangers ]]
DUNEDAIN_EXPAND_BODY = [[As their lords begin to reveal their true nature, their nobility and the thickening blood of the once-lost Dúnedain, the people of the broken kingdom have united under common cause and the banner of the mightiest living men in all of Middle-earth. Through flourishing trade, the gathering of men to banner and the steely resolve that grips man and beast alike, the old ways return and such an outpouring of faith has built that it would sweep aside once confident foes. Along with the responsibility for a fallen realm, strength has come at last to the Dúnedain, and the return of such to a contested land has revealed a power that has slept for as long as tales of like have been told. ]]
DUNEDAIN_EXPAND_TITLE = [[The Rangers Flourish ]]
DUNLENDING_DIMINISH_BODY = [[What was the spilling of simple hatred into a land once-theirs has turned to the swirling cries of grieving widows. Amongst the huts of the Hill-folk, the crow-feathered dead lie in funeral pyres and burn for the dreams that were fed by eternal bitterness. The dead do not speak, but their sacrifice is just one part in a dance to the death. Still yet the hunger could save them, for hunger is more than drives some other men to victory. ]]
DUNLENDING_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Dunland Dwindles ]]
DUNLENDING_EXPAND_BODY = [[The Hill-men of Dunland have cascaded into violence, and their bitter memories have driven this engine of destruction. Never the route of traders for the Dunlendings, they take the lands that their memories run deep within, and success brings them to the realisation that there is more to conquer than what was...what could be is a far better future memory to fight for. ]]
DUNLENDING_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Dunland Expands! ]]
ENEDWAITH_DIMINISH_BODY = [[That which the fragile Collective of Enedwaith most feared has come to pass. The devastation suffered in the past has come once more, and the fledgling unity is passing into hidden flight once again. The scattered hill villages lay broken, their straw huts ripped open. The forests are hacked and lined with the listless dead, bodies decaying, still show gaping wounds festering with flies. A sadness grips all but the stone-hearted. What can be done to save and nurture them? ]]
ENEDWAITH_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Enedwaith Falters ]]
ENEDWAITH_EXPAND_BODY = [[The weakness of Enedwaith is a memory now, as the Provinces come under a common banner, their memories clung to in faith not long in its birthing. The faithless grasp their old glory and vow to rise for a common cause. Enedwaith and its allied Provinces ascend from disparate elements to a force of hope and reckoning. Beware the new power of the ravaged lands! ]]
ENEDWAITH_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Enedwaith Expands! ]]
ENTS_DIMINISH_BODY = [[Burning trees, downtrodden plants, squashed flowers bleed their colours. The Forest Herders have gone on their march, to be met by strong opponents - stronger indeed than any foresaw in their troubled dreams. What could have been a glorious ascent into the very power of Yavanna appears to be stumbling, halting in its steps, yet all is not done - even in times like these. They are still possessed of great strength, and the tale is not yet over. Can the tide turn, or will the savaging of the Olvar reach a deadly conclusion? ]]
ENTS_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Fangorn Falters ]]
ENTS_EXPAND_BODY = [[The Ents are ascendant. Against all of the odds, against all of their fears, they find their strength that others guessed at long ago. In the years of the First Age, they were strong, and, in this Third Age of the Sun they have found that same strength again! Retribution is theirs, and the minions of fierce, fetid evil have had their armies ravaged by this seemingly unstoppable force. For trees are strong - their roots penetrate rock over a hundred years, they split earth as if it were nothing, and the Ents fight like trees accelerated a hundred times over. The outer walls of even the strongest of cities will be surely be breached by a thousand years of Nature in mere minutes, and the scions of entropy will face more than they ever knew, or ever imagined, in their arrogant cries of the prowess of their fighting forces. ]]
ENTS_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Fangorn Thrives ]]
EREBOR_DIMINISH_BODY = [[The Kingdom-under-the-Mountain seemed so bright, its elder glory restored. King Dáin had amassed fortunes and allies were strong in their resolve. It seems now that these were echoes of dreams, a longing of false hope, as the tattered bodies of the Naugrim litter the Dwarf roads, their enemies beat at the gates, and doom seems distinct. There is a future that is on the brink of an abyss - too dark to shine into with any light. Only timely intervention and vicious battle can save them now. ]]
EREBOR_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Erebor Wains ]]
EREBOR_EXPAND_BODY = [[The fortunes of the Dwarves are brighter than ever. Long had the dream of mountain-realm of Erebor been confined to the dusky Iron Hills, but now it seems that the death of Smaug has given a glorious Fate back to the Dwarves. With Dáin's leadership, they have been reborn as a strong nation, deep rooted in the mountain of Erebor. Their forces are challenging all foes with the very might that all would have faithlessly dreamed restored! ]]
EREBOR_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Erebor Expands! ]]
GALADHRIM_DIMINISH_BODY = [[It seems to be a foolish decision that the Galadhrim did not rescind to the Undying Lands. Of all things grief will destroy Elves, and they grieve for their dead and the crumbling of Lórien's armies. Elf-friends must respond, or else they will fall into Shadow. Enemies of Lórien must press their advantage and exterminate their race for good. ]]
GALADHRIM_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Lórien Wanes ]]
GALADHRIM_EXPAND_BODY = [[The woods of Lórien are filled with song and secretive celebration. In the deepest parts of the forest, upon Amroth and Caras Galadhon, the beauty and grace is resounding. The leadership of Celeborn was always filled with belief, and he brings his war mastery to fruitful success. It cannot be seen that Lórien will wither, and its forces grow stronger with each falling leaf of the Mallorn Trees. ]]
GALADHRIM_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Lórien Prospers ]]
GONDOR_DIMINISH_BODY = [[These are dark times indeed for the free peoples and a sign of strength for the shadow as the forces of darkness are bold enough and strong enough to encroach upon the Gondorian heartland. The river Anduin sweeps away the masses of Gondorian dead, their blood turns the river a deep red. The Pelennor is shaken and cracked and all about the green fields of Gondor lie the shafts of arrows and bolts of Ballistae. If the tide of battle does not change in Gondor's favour, the glorious kingdom may be lost forever. And if Gondor falls, who will stand against the darkness in the east? ]]
GONDOR_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Gondor Weakened ]]
GONDOR_EXPAND_BODY = [[Since the line of kings ended, the stewards took reign of Gondor's leadership and this once glorious nation began to decline, losing territories and citadels to the enemy. However the power of Númenor has shone through the men of Gondor as they reclaim that which was lost and expand their borders further than they have been since the days of Steward Cirion! The land of stone shakes as its vast armies march to and fro protecting Gondor's people and claiming more land. The kingdom rejoices as the Gondorian heartland of old is reunited under the banner of the stewards. Perhaps this is a herald of a new Gondorian Golden Age! ]]
GONDOR_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Gondorian Splendour ]]
HARAD_DIMINISH_BODY = [[The strange birds pick clean the flesh from bodies littering the roadsides and cairn-fostered battlefields. Scarlet cloaks drift amidst gold and black spiked armoury, and the split helm lies across the ravaged faces of swarthy skinned youths, glassy looks echo in the staring, once-white, eyes of the Troll-Men of the farthest reaches Harad. All is not well in the House of the Black Serpent, and knives flicker in alleyways as much of the fighting begins to foster itself amongst the nobles of a Kingdom lacking hope or direction. To the wise, those that see clearly enough through obfuscating veils, it appears, at last, that the Head of the Snake is slowly being torn from its writhing body... ]]
HARAD_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Harad's Decline ]]
HARAD_EXPAND_BODY = [[The Rise of Harad, a land under strange stars, has gathered momentum, as levies of the dark skinned warriors of Far Harad stream into the northerly provinces. The war engine of Haradwaith, folk of the Serpent Black, has propelled itself into action, combining its growing military strength with a network of trade and insidious government that betrays and whispers softly amidst silken curtains, and now terrorises the dangerously threatened West, perhaps beyond even Gondor itself! ]]
HARAD_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Heartlands of the Haradrim ]]
IMLADRIS_DIMINISH_BODY = [[Like cuts on the body of Arda itself, the trees along the wooded dells of Imladris bear the wounds of war. Some have burned in assaults, others wounded by their witness of the death of the great and wondrous - the failure of the song of Middle-earth's greatest notes, the Elves of the Ñoldor. A bitter-tasting, darkly entropic failure to keep their foes at bay! Mangled silver-banded forms dot the landscape, mixed by great numbers of the beastial Orcs, but somehow each death of a single star-blessed Ñoldor has lessened the sight of the havoc they wrought in their dying. Events turn against the House of Elrond, and it will take a master of miracles to turn aside the flow of stricken savagery that may yet follow. ]]

Some have burned in assaults, others wounded by their witness of the death of the great and wondrous - the failure of the song of Middle-earth's greatest notes, the Elves of the Ñoldor. A bitter-tasting, darkly entropic failure to keep their foes at bay! Mangled silver-banded forms dot the landscape, mixed by great numbers of the bestial orcs, but somehow each death of a single star-blessed Ñoldor has lessened the sight of the havoc they wrought in their dying. Events turn against the House of Feanor, and it will take a master of miracles to turn aside the flow of stricken savagery that may yet follow. ]]
EREGION_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Eregion occupied ]]
EREGION_EXPAND_BODY = [[The green valleys and hills of Eregion, Ost-in-Edhil of the Ñoldor, has sent its few to war! These few hold much of the grace of what was the fire of Valinor, their eyes bear the lilting light of the trees of brazen gold and shimmering silver. Ever the lights burn at night and the star of Elbereth, a twinkling and gloried gem of unseen years, lifts the march of golden breathed Eldar. They leave flowers in the snow as they cross into the stone-bitten goblin-lands and through mountainous ruins, slaying all in their path with a joyous chant, abandoning their detachment in a fury of white fire that savages and berates foes of far less valour! Craven and bullying, sly and sneaking; all of this kind shall wither in the wrath of Valinor reborn! ]]
EREGION_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Eregion Supreme! ]]
ISENGARD_DIMINISH_BODY = [[Saruman's dreams are troubled of late, and voices whisper through the blackness of his sleeping chamber. He has gazed into the palantír of Orthanc and sees much of import in the world; much that is hidden from others, he sees. An image of a Great Eye, wreathed in flame, has come upon him, and the chamber of the palantír echoes with the Black Speech. The other White Council members are concerned by his distraction of late, and the fortunes of all balance precariously indeed. His delving’s into lost Lore become ever more obsessive, and they are not all driven by selflessness any more... ]]
ISENGARD_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Orthanc Troubles ]]
ISENGARD_EXPAND_BODY = [[Turning his back on the Valar and pursuing a course of total domination was bound to attract enemies the world over but the power of Saruman has been underestimated and now his hordes of heavily clad warriors spread out far across the lands. There are few who can now match the power of the Black Tower and even the Dark Lord of Mordor begins to re-check his defences. ]]
ISENGARD_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Orthanc Flourishes ]]
GUNDABAD_DIMINISH_BODY = [[Under the cover of the freezing northern wind, the Snow-orcs have begun to retreat into the wastes of Forodwaith. Their numbers have been thinned almost to extinction and their few remaining warriors can no longer carry the glorious purpose that they came from the north with. They are in ruin and will disappear from the histories of Middle-earth once more. ]]
GUNDABAD_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Snow-orcs Retreat ]]
GUNDABAD_EXPAND_BODY = [[The Snow-orcs have truly made their name and presence known in Middle-earth as they have grown from the mountain of Gundabad into a mighty kingdom! There is little question that they will now sweep the north unchecked. ]]
GUNDABAD_EXPAND_TITLE = [[Snow-orc Dominion! ]]
KHAND_DIMINISH_BODY = [[The horn blast that is Khand is spent. The charging horsemen, the mounted archers, their arrows seem spent, their energies discharged, and they have ridden too far, too fast. Their front lines are crumbling, their reinforcements late to the field, and must re-evaluate their strategy, else they be broken of the spears of their foes, transfixed by the weapons of those they sought so arrogantly to subjugate. ]]

KHAND_EXPAND_BODY = [[The Hordes of Khand are come! Like a cracking whip, the horsemen of Khand have thundered into the West, smashing through the defences of all in their path, decimating and destroying, burning and pillaging. Yet their ultimate goal is one of assimilation - for that is what the Variags of Khand do, how they have become so strong. Is there nothing that can be done, at this hour, so late in coming? ]]
KHAND_EXPAND_TITLE = [[The Wrath of Khand ]]
KHAZAD_DIMINISH_BODY = [[Ori records the efforts of Balin's company in the Book of Mazarbul, but his words have turned dark of late. The Dwarf kingdom lies in dangers reach, claws of evil, and Durin's Bane awakes and seek to push them from their valiant goal. The very nature of Dwarves themselves does not spell an ending, but they are beleaguered and spread more thinly now that the lists of the fallen fill Ori's tome to brimming. What future shall we find in the Book of Mazarbul? Will we prise it from dead hands, or see its glory as was meant to be? ]]
KHAZAD_DIMINISH_TITLE = [[Moria Wanes ]]
KHAZAD_EXPAND_BODY = [[Given the task ahead of them, the difficulty of Balin's mission has borne fruit. The Kingdom under the peaks of Caradhras, Khazad-dûm, is restored to life once more: the greater Halls and mines of their forbearers, the deeps of Moria have been taken and restored to their old names. Trade is again leaving the Dwarf Hold, and gold, silver and even Mithril flows from rock to wonder. Arms and armour are hammered to life by great Dwarven Smiths, and the power of Balin's expedition increases daily. ]]

LINDON_DIMINISH_BODY = [[The Stars themselves are dimmed tonight, the grace of the world troubled in its silvered sleep. The decimation of the Ñoldor is a sight to send anything of good grace to its knees, riven by tears of trembling despair as the world itself grieves. In guileless weeping, rivers pour more swiftly as they shed their mourning; swans and tiny sparrows swirl in lessened skies, and no birds of carrion settle upon the dead, still carrying a trace of wondrous grace in their mutilated corpses.

LUIN_RING_INTRO_BODY = [[Since the awakening of the Dwarves in the First Age, two clans have called the Blue Mountains home: the Firebeards and the Broadbeams. For many years, peace, harmony and prosperity reigned in the mansions of the Dwarves and the Blue Mountains became a bulwark against the growing shadow of Morgoth. Then, the fates of the Dwarves changed when Fëanor and his exiles landed on the western shores of Beleriand.\n\nThe Noldor favoured crafting, smithing and good solid rock to shape. They were masons, weaponsmiths, carpenters and jewellers and they were taught by Aulë himself. For some Dwarves, the Noldor were an affront to their very existence. After all, were the Dwarves not the children of Aulë, children of the smith and hammer? Were they not blessed as the greatest craftsmen? This rumbling of discontent spread amongst the Dwarves and like-minded groups began to gather in the shadows, whispering against their Elf-loving lords and kings. In time, they came together as a unified and secretive movement: the Grimborn.\n\nThe Noldor, unaware of a growing threat from the Dwarves, looked down on those they named the 'stunted folk'. They were haughty and proud and gave little consideration for the Dwarves. The bitter rivalry between the craftsmen of the Blue Mountains and those of the Elves turned to hatred. Blinded by the searing flame of their anger, the Grimborn eventually came to treat all of the surface dwellers with equal contempt be they Grey-elf or green, Sindar or Noldor, Elf or Human, it mattered not, they all stood in the way of Dwarven glory. The agents of the Grimborn were able to penetrate every level of Dwarven society but had still not declared themselves openly. Their goal was war: total Dwarven supremacy and they were handed this opportunity by the Elves themselves.\n\nThe Nauglamir was a famed Elven necklace that was near peerless in its beauty. Only three magnificent gems could surpass it in quality. They were the Simlarils. The Elves of Menegroth came into possession of one Silmaril and desired to have it set into the Nauglamir to create a necklace worthy of Varda herself. A company of Dwarves (unknowingly lead by two Grimborn agents) was in Menegroth at this time and were tasked with the binding of the two jewels. Seizing the opportunity, the Grimborn agents convinced the Dwarves to abscond with the completed necklace as surely an item of this quality should only be held by the sons of the great craftsmen! As the Dwarves fled, Thingol himself tried to stop them and was slain in cold blood. The loss of the King of Doriath was a blow to the Sindar and the Dwarves were hunted. Two Dwarves made it back to Nogrod, two Grimborn Dwarves. They spun a tale of lies: "Thingol had slain the Dwarves instead of pay them!" they said, "the Elves betrayed the Dwarves good nature" they cried, "how can we not be sure they won't attack us to silence the truth!" they asked. The Mountains erupted: an army of the Dwarves was sent to enact vengeance on the Elves and in the 503rd year of the First Age of the Sun, the great Elven city of Menegroth was sacked by the Dwarves. A dark day in Middle-earth's history but a glorious victory for the Grimborn. They had achieved their goal and, seizing their moment, they announced themselves as the eighth clan of the Dwarves. Their numbers swelled with Firebeards and Broadbeams willingly giving up their lineage to join this new powerful clan.\n\nAfter many years of isolation and grudge-bearing, the Grimborn became the most wealthy and powerful Dwarven clan but the Blue Mountains became a dark and dangerous place. As the years past, the fortunes of the Dwarves changed for the worse when Beleriand sunk beneath the sea. The loyal Firebeards and Broadbeams, who had fled to southern Ered Luin and established the hidden city of Buzra-dûm, now abandoned the Blue Mountains for good. As one they left for Khazad-dûm and their faithful Longbeard comrades. The Grimborn stayed. They lived on in the ruins of Belegost and Nogrod, bearing their undying grudge against all surface dwellers. They scraped by a meagre existence and their numbers gradually dwindled. Many Grimborn returned to their kin in the east and forsook the Grim-oath they had given centuries before. Many simply gave up of life; unable to live under such crushing hate and anger with no means to impact the path of the world.\n\nThrough desertion, death and madness, over the next one thousand years, the number of Grimborn fell away to almost nothing. When the Longbeards, Firebeards and Broadbeams came back to the west after the sackings of Khazad-dûm and Erebor they found a mere handful of Dwarves still living in Ered Luin. This small family of Grimborn were integrated back into normal Dwarven society and their legacy was forgotten. However, when Thorin & Company reclaimed Erebor some years later, many Longbeards returned to the Lonely Mountain leaving Ered Luin small in population.\n\nNow, in the waning years of the Third Age, the Grimborn have managed to endure and claw back some small amount of power in Blue Mountain society. For the most part, they are shunned, looked down on by their fellow Dwarves who have not forgotten the hurt caused by the Grimborn in the First Age. However, apathy breeds ignorance and the Grimborn are poised to return to power. The actions of Clanlord Gor will now define a new era for the Dwarves of Ered Luin - will they rise as champions of Eriador or fall into the black pages of history once again, tarnished forever by one name: Grimborn. ]]

Their numbers have consistently declined and support for their cause has always been nothing more than a low murmur. However, As Durin is reborn anew with the passing ages, so to does it seem that the Grimborn have their own hero: Grindfârn. Grindfârn has garnered more support for his cause in the last few years than any Grimborn leader has in the past one thousand. He speaks of a better life for the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains, his speeches do not speak of hatred, anger or war but rather of peace, prosperity and glory. Many rally to his banner and he has found himself at the head of a tidal wave of wanted change. They hail him as Khazin reborn.\n\nTo hear that name spoken in these halls again is an ill omen. Khazin was the mightiest leader of the Grimborn and it was he who announced the "8th Clan" after the sacking of Menegroth. Grindfârn is clever my Lord, he doesn't speak of all out war but he subtly blames our troubles on the Elves and their decision to stay in Middle-earth. He talks of our "great and powerful kin" who were able to reclaim Moria with only a small expedition. He stirs a fire in the hearts of the Dwarves, he claims that if the lesser Dwarves of Erebor can reclaim Moria then think on what the great Dwarves of Ered Luin could do!

He said that he was here on behalf of a Great Lord of the South who had come into possession of three great rings. This benevolent lord was willing to give the rings to the Dwarves and in return he asked only one thing: that we shut the gates of the Mountains and let none come or go until the Emissary returned. He spoke of how these rings would bring us great wealth and strength and that they surpassed the "old seven" in majesty and power. Our guards met his request with scorn. We Dwarves are not so easily fooled, they bid him show them the rings and they will bring his message to the Clanlord. In a flash of dazzling light, the Emissary dismounted his horse and was down on his knees before the guards, his arm outstretched and on his dark fingers sat three fantastic rings.

But now once more the engines of war churn from Mordor, the great blackened sky stretching forth from behind the ash covered mountains of the Dark Lord’s domain. The great nation of Gondor once more must stand up against the coming darkness and be the bulwark which the rest of Middle-earth must depend upon, Denethor takes to the seeing stone to safeguard his nation, a great risk to take, something hundreds of years of Stewards had not dared do before him, for even the best minds do not fully know what happened to the Ithil Stone and the consequences of peering beyond the great mountains and into the east could lead to untold disaster. ]]

The malevolent Maia occasionally whispers to Denethor. Sauron wishes to turn the stone against the Steward in order to undermine all he has done so far to defend the free people.

Denethor, now aware of Sauron’s presence in the great stones treads carefully and is hesitant to use the Palantir for fear of the Dark Lord’s trickery. But now the Southrons stur and the Orcish hordes asail, the time for caution and contemplation is not within the hands of the Steward. Taking to the eye with the clear goal of defending his people, Denethor resists the power of the Dark Lord and his attempts to destroy the proud Gondorian’s mind, hope seems to be shining down upon the Dunedain and Middle-earth and once more the tide of evil will be stayed, allowing for yet another age of peace. ]]

They are still men, and their time upon earth is finite, while the heirs of the Dunedain are mightier than the simple man, they are finite, unlike the undying Elves. Denethor begins to wane, his time in political and tactical debates take a greater toll on his mind… and as a result, the seeing stone has become a more vital, yet far more deadly asset. Sauron continues his assault upon the Steward’s mind, and is beginning to break down the great wall of the dwindling Steward, age has finally caught up to the man, his willpower, strength, wisdom; all slowly escaping his body. But despite this, Denethor is still a proud carrier of the blood of Numenor, of the Dunedain, of the strongest race of men to grace Middle-earth, his people are his sacred charge, and he stands as defiant as one can against the barrage unleashed by Sauron. The host of the Dark Lord's forces grows in size and diversity everyday, from the Mumakil of the Haradrim to the Uruks of Gorgoroth, Denethor will command his great armies to combat this foe until they are spent.

What was once a great, kind and caring steward have been replaced by a sad, depressed and near broken man, choosing to seclude himself to his chambers and the towers of Minas Tirith. To look out at the blackened sky and ash covered mountains, once he looked out in defiance, and with hope… now he sees defeat, from that mountain range another army will come forth, thousands of Uruks and Orcs crashing into the frontline, the defenders valiantly holding the line in a way that would make any of Steward proud, but now to Denethor it felt like a futile gesture against an inevitable defeat at the hands of Sauron’s minions. Despite this seemingly maddened state, a small amount of hope remained, in brief, yet fleeting moments, Denethor believed in the cause, believed that they could turn the tide and reclaim Ithilien, reclaim the lost fortress and bring down the Dark Lord like the great Kings of old had done at the end of the Second Age… but this was fleeting, Sauron pressed upon his mind, closing in like a vice until he could finally break the Steward, and hopefully pull Gondor down with him ]]

The defenders of Gondor slowly begin to break, as the death sentence is slowly signed, letter by letter, an entire nation subjected to death at the hands of its own Steward, rash acts are the only way to save Gondor now, should Denethor be allowed to reign further… the White city will burn and it’s people butchered in the name of Sauron… Only hope left for Denethor now is Destruction of Mordor and the ring. ]]

Even though he refused the position as leader of the White Council, Gandalf's vigilance and subtlety exposed the Necromancer of Dol Guldur as Sauron and forced him to abandon his stronghold in Mirkwood. Chains of events set by Gandalf and directed through Bilbo the Hobbit and his Dwarven comrades resulted in the fall of Smaug, the last of the great Fire-drakes, as well as a crushing defeat for the Orcs of the Misty Mountains in the Battle of the Five Armies. Following those events the Wizard focused on the search for Sauron's One Ring which led him to the creature Gollum believed to have possessed the One Ring for a time. In T.A. 2956 Gandalf's search for Gollum brought him into contact with Aragorn, an exiled descendant of Isildur whose noble bloodline lay claim to thrones of both Gondor and what was once the Kingdom of Arnor. Their shared concern for Middle-earth and its people forged a friendship and an alliance that would grow to become the strongest opposition to Sauron's desire to dominate all life.

Moria is not only important for its spiritual value or the size of the settlement but mostly because the precious metal Mithril can be mined here.\n\nDuring the First and Second Age Moria became a great settlement which was allied with both Elves and Men. During this period the door of Moria was created by the Dwarf Narvi and the Elf Celebrimbor. The Dwarves expanded Moria into a seven-level settlement with a great hall, many rooms like the Chamber of Mazarbul, tunnels, Durin's bridge and the Endless stairs which ascended from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, where it terminated within Durin's Tower on top of the Zirakzigil.\n\nMoria even survived the attacks of Sauron but finally, the settlement was lost to a demon which could not be harmed by steel nor stone. In the deepness of Khazad-dûm, a Balrog of Morgoth awoke because of the mithril mining and he killed king Durin the sixth and his son Náin. The Dwarves had no choice but to abandon Moria and relocated to Erebor.\n\nMany centuries later, in 2790, driven from Erebor by the dragon Smaug, Thrór, heir of Durin, attempted to re-enter his ancestral home despite warnings not to. He was slain by the Orc chieftain Azog, a murder that precipitated The War of the Dwarves and Orcs culminating in a bloody battle outside Moria's eastern gates nine years later.

In this case, the One Ring must be brought to Isengard for its power to fully have effect on the Dominion (if you don't own Isengard, you'll have to capture it).

So, it might be better if you relinquish the power and hand it over to Sauron. Sauron will be most pleased by the latter choice.\n This decision must not be rushed my Lord, for the consequences for both options are very great; the future of Middle-earth may depend on your decision.\n\nGAMENOTE: You have to choose which path you 'll follow. Once you'll have brought the One Ring to Isengard and decide to keep it for yourself, you won't have any other chance to unleash Sauron.

Among the race of men, there are few in history who have been able to attune to the ways of magic and the Witch-king is the only one ever to be held as a master. There can be no doubt however that his power and knowledge only blossomed when he embraced the teachings of Sauron. Now, in the waning years of the Third Age, the Witch-king stands as the mightiest of all Sauron's servants. Blessed (or cursed) with an invincibility against almost all who would seek to harm him, he is perhaps the most dangerous foe the free peoples may face on the field. ]]

LEOFRIC_BODY = [[Leofric was born into a simple life and for all the years of his youth he lived the life of his forefathers as a shepherd in the vast plains of Rhovanion. He grew tall and strong and was contented. As tradition dictated, when Leofric was 10 his father gave to him his first sword - a sturdy blade of simple steel forged by the smithies of Glaemsburh. Leofric quickly set himself apart with the sword and proved to be something of a natural. Far more than that, he possesed a skill with the blade that none in the north had seen in living memory. In time, his fame as the "untrained swordmaster" spread and eventually, challengers came to test their mettle against this wonder boy from the plains. Ten more summers passed and his fame and strength grew and grew until there was none left to challenge him. Little did he know that by far his greatest challenge was already mustering to the south.\n\nTo begin with, none knew from whence they came and worse still, none expected them. They were horrible, vile, creatures that lolloped across the ground with clumsy and unnerving strides, snarling and biting as they came. They fell upon towns and camps in the dead of night and their skin was blackened and charred as though they were created in fire itself. The Northmen swiftly came to call them the "Burning Death" but the Elders knew what they were: Orcs. Their presence in the north was more than just petty raiding parties, a vast army had been sent from the south to enslave the hardy northmen for the machinations of the Dark Lord.\n\nAt this time the Northmen had no king and they lived in small townsteads or as farmers and nomads on the plains, going where the herds lead them. In times of strife they looked to village Elders for guidance but not leadership. With no central figure to rally behind or to give hope and guidance, panic spread amongst the North like wildfire. There were many strong warriors amongst the Northmen but without a captain or a strategy, they couldn't hope to hold back the rising tide. All was to change however when the Burning Death finally came upon Leofric's homestead. By that time, he knew of the Orcs well, everyone did, he knew it would only be a matter of time before their plundering attacks brought them to his home. He had made ready. He began by teaching any who could wield a blade the art of swordmanship: young lads, old farmers, staunch wifes, tall sons and brave daughters. First his homestead, then his neighbours, then their neighbours and beyond. It was not long before word spread that a champion had risen in the North and was assembling an army to end this plague once and for all! Hundreds flocked to his homestead to fight by his side or to learn from this master. Leofric spoke to each and every person who came to his home and they found in him hope. Hope that the dying ruins of the north could be born again under a brighter star. Admiration for Leofric grew strong and his simple homestead grew into a ramshackle and makeshift city. The Elders who had been forced to seek refuge with Leofric came together and resolved to see the North return to glory. They called to Leofric in the dead of night and before a crowd of some ten thousand, they proclaimed him Leofric I, King of all Northmen. News of his coronation spread wide and in time, this news came on the wind to the Orcs themselves. The Orcs had grown fat from easy victory after easy victory and they were complacent in their success. They underestimated the Northmen and thought nothing of this 'Upstart' king and marched to meet him with little concern. Leofric proved not only to be a man of the people, a warrior of honour and a true son of Rhovanion but also a master tactician. His armies dealt an earth shattering blow to the Orcs and the ripple of this defeat was felt in the heart of Mordor itself.\n\nLeofric and his army then scoured Rhovanion, gathering more supporters and scattering and slaughtering any Orc that came before their path. His success threatened to boil over into a very crusade against the home of this Burning Death with Northmen from all of Rhovanion crying out for vengeance! Instead, their cries were challenged by the most feared being of all: Sauron.\n\nRiding north with an army numbered in the hundreds of thousands, come to put down this upstart King once and for all. Sauron met Leofric's army in the very heart of Rhovanion. There, he called on Leofric to meet him in the field in single combat. Leofric met the call. He stood before the dark visage of the Lord of Shadow and he did not waver. Sauron felt the power, strength and honour of this man and his mind saw opportunity. He spoke to Leofric "I see you have earned your reputation as King of the North well, boy. But your advisers feed you untruths: I come here not as conqueror but as ally! Your command of your people is to be commended and I see in them a strength I never thought possible. Further bloodshed here would be folly! I offer you a simple exchange: my army will disband, return south and not trouble your land or your people again. You can live in peace! In return, I ask only that you accept this simple ring as a token of my esteem and wear it always to remind you of our accord here today. What say you?"\n\nLeofric did not speak. He looked out at Sauron's gathered horde and the threat that would forever reside to the south of his land, his ancestors land, his peoples land. Silently, he raised his arm, his hand widespread. Suddenly, he clenched his fist and in an instant the sky was darkened with the black shafts of the Northmen. Leofric's forces were gravely outnumbered but the Orcs, even those lead by Sauron himself, could not hope to content with the storm of precise arrow fire now whistling toward them. Thousands of the enemy were cast down in the initial volleys but this was not their first battle. The Orcs quickly regrouped and raised their shields high. Then, to the sound of a hundred clear ringing horns, they mastered their fear and charged into the waiting lines of the Northmen. The battle was bloody and fierce. The Orcs had met a challenge in the Northmen that would not be easily overcome.\n\nLeofric watched on, pride swelling in his chest, as the Orcs fell to the stalwart defenders of the North, for every man who fell, 5 Orcs would fall with him. Confident, he turned his gaze back to Sauron. The tall figure before him showed no signs of outward emotion nor, to Leofric's dismay, any obvious weakness. Sauron began to close on Leofric and where before he had been unarmed, a great mace now cut through the air. The head of this ghastly weapon was as large as a pig and could crush Leofric in a single blow. He drew his sword, gave a thought to his forefathers and charged in silence. It is said the fight between Sauron and Leofric rent the very earth about their feet and sent flames high into the sky. Sword and mace both wielded effortlessly and with grace. Neither opponent showed a sign of dropping or made a mistake. They fought for what seemed like hours until Sauron was able to strike a powerful blow to Leofric's leg. He crashed to the ground and all his hope and thought of victory crashed with him. His leg was broken. It took all his strength to kneel upon his other leg, lest he show weakness before his men. Sauron had won and Leofric, head down, waited for the end but it did not come. A voice whispered in his ear: "Take this ring Leofric, take it and wear it everafter or I will cleanse the North of every living thing. This decision I give to you: your people or your pride." Leofric knew his lands would never truly shake of the threat of Mordor but he couldn't allow his people to perish here. He couldn't allow his ancestors to be forgotten. He raised up his hand with an outstretched finger and bowed his head low. Sauron gave a sign to his bannerman and a loud clear horn rang out. Suddenly the Orcs retreated en masse and all the gathered Northmen still standing could see, in the centre of the field, their King, bowing to Sauron. The Lord of Shadow placed a simple golden ring upon the kneeling King's finger. To the bewilderement of the Northmen, Sauron gave a short bow to Leofric and then turned about and walked away. His army, fell in line to his sides and with that, the Orc incursion in the North ended.\n\nSo it came to pass that the mighty King Leofric the Bowed came under the power of Sauron. ]]

LAGOREN_BODY = [[Lagoren was born in the year S.A 1702 to a Númenórean father and a Middlemen mother. His parents relationship was passionate and loving but brief. His father was recalled from the colonies to Númenor and custom dictated that middlemen women were not allowed on Númenor unless they had been wedded. Lagoren would never meet his father. After his father left, his mother, Siwini, moved to the hills to the south of Tarlang's Neck where the Númenórean influence had not taken root and she could be amongst her own people. There was a small township there that was far removed from the worries and torments of the wider world.\n\nLagoren was ably guided through his youth by Siwini and he grew to be a compassionate and thoughtful young man. He didn't inherit his father's physical strength but he showed an immense intellect and had a deep-love of reading: the middlemen had little use for books but the Númenóreans favoured them and they had become widespread in the coastlands. Lagoren's life was easy and calm and he was able to while away he days deep in thought and story. Lagoren was quickly hailed by many in the town as something of a genius and he was often consulted by the towns Elders on matters of governance, trade and education. He learnt as much from the Elders as they from him and he became governor of the Neck in all but name. \n\nThe lands about the Neck were untroubled by wars, bandits or raiders and only packs of wolves ever presented a danger. This safety allowed Lagoren to partake in his most favoured past-time - long walks. He ventured as far a field as his long legs would carry him and would regale his mother with news of far away towns and stories of his "adventures".\n\nWhen Lagoren turned 25 he marked the occasion by embarking on what was to be his greatest adventure yet: to pass through the Neck and head out to the west to meet with the people of the mountains and far western coastland. He gathered enough provisions and supplies to support him for what would likely be many weeks and, on a crisp and cool Spring morning, with a long word of farewell to Siwini, he set off. It would be two days of walking before he was through the Neck and he knew he would need to take rest in that rocky and unforgiving passage. As night fell on the first day he found a small cave and set up camp. After an adequate supper and a good drink he began to doze by the warmth of his fire until he heard a loud cry. The voice sounded foreign to Lagoren and he rushed to see what was going on.\n\nOver a small hill Lagoren came across the source of the commotion. A traveller in tatty and torn clothes, walking with a limp and armed with only a simple staff, was desperately fighting off a pack of wolves. Lagoren had never been skilled with a blade and was only armed himself with his tallest walking stick. Nevertheless, he had had dealings with the wolves and knew what they feared more than hunger: fire. He rushed back to his camp and using what he could find, made some torches. When he returned, the traveller was almost overcome and the beasts were nearly upon him. Lagoren sprang into the midst of the maelstrom and swung carelessly, this way and that, with his makeshift torches. The wolves were caught off guard and the sudden arrival of this flaming banshee sent them into panic. After only a few moments, they broke and fled. Knowing it would not be long until they mustered the courage to return however, Lagoren led the stranger away to his camp.\n\nThe man was shaken and barely able to hold conversation. Lagoren sat him down and gave him food, water and warmth. After a time, the fellow announced his name as Annatar and said he had travelled from the north to seek a place of safety to live out his days. He said most of his family had been slain in the north, in wars or raids and he was all that was left. He thanked Lagoren for saving him and for the food and water and he took some rest.\n\nWhen morning broke, Lagoren and Annatar talked long together: from events of the distant past to the recent cleansing of the Northern lands. Lagoren delighted in the company of Annatar, who had great knowledge of the past and seemed to him more than a simple traveller, but he needed to move on and as the sun reached its height, the two men tidied to the camp to leave. Before departing, Annatar offered Lagoren a simple ring of fine gold in payment for all that the youth had done. "Take this ring, Lagoren" he said, "take it and remember old Annatar when the night closes in. May it serve you as well as it has served me! Promise to wear it always and it will be sure to give you good health and good luck! Farewell!" Lagoren was awestruck, he had never seen such a beatutiful yet simple ring in all his days, he happily placed the ring on his finger and felt a surge of energy and vibrance flow through him as he did. He thanked Annatar and the two men set off, never to see each other again.\n\nLagoren completed his adventure and then some: bullied by the stories Annatar had told, he covered all the lands between the White Mountains and the coast and when his feet were finally longing for home, he turned back to Tarlang's Neck.\n\nIn the years that followed, Lagoren's knowledge and skill grew and grew. The lands around the Neck flourished under his guiding hand and the people were contented. To their memory, the people could not remember the last time life was so easy. Lagoren showed a keen skill in the art of craftmanship and inventing and he created an abundance of new tools to help work the land and let the people get on with doing what they like best - drinking and relaxing! He brought wealth, peace and prosperity to any who he dealt with and even as he grew older, he never seemed a day over 25.\n\nLife was to change for Lagoren on the morning of his 45th birthday. He awoke to a feeling he had never had before, a strange calling within him. It was as though he could hear another voice in his head commanding him to "return". Return? he thought, I have nowhere to return to? He gave little heed to this at first and thought it was nothing more than old age or one of life's oddities. However:- as each day passed, the calling grew stronger and stronger until it was as though a great chorus was crying out in his head each morning. Eventually, the voices were accompanied by a strange shape in his mind. Each time he closed his eyes he could see a silhouette but at first he couldn not make out what it was.\n\n After almost three more months had passed he could see it was the shape of a head, and more than that, the head was the source of the calling. Each day it mouthed to him: "return to me now". The sound was deafening by now and lagoren dreaded waking each morning. He took to avoiding sleep where he could but each time he blinked, he could see the shadow. One night, as Lagoren took to bed and braced for the nightmares ahead, he closed his eyes and was struck cold. His breath left him and he felt paralysed: staring back at him from behind his eyes, as clear as though he were in the room was the face of Annatar. Not the Annatar he had met, this face was young and vibrant, with a fair complexion and a handsome hold. Long slender elfin ears peaked through the waves of black hair but it was umistakeably the same man as he had met all those years ago. Lagoren could not understand it. This made no sense. At once he made his way to his own personal library. Every book he had ever read, or could ever hope to read, was stacked high in the vast inner chamber of his palatial home. He was determined to find out any scrap of information he could about this Annatar. He spent two full days locked in his library, claiming only the briefest moments of sleep to stave off the madness and then he found it. A dusty and tattered tome that had come from the north with a passing merchant. He was told it was penned by the Elves themselves and nobody had wanted to buy it for few read it. Lagoren could and it was in this ancient book he found three words of hastily scrawled font at the back of the book: "Annatar, Sauron, decieved."\n\nLagoren knew at once that it was not a simple oldman he had met on the road but Sauron himself: fleeing from the north where his armies had been utterly destroyed.\n\nLagoren felt a chill run over him, and his head was a whir with a thousand different thoughts and then he saw it: a glimmer in the corner of his eye, a reflection of the firelight on his hand. The Ring. He dropped the book and gazed long at the ring. He realised in that moment that he too had been decieved. He must destroy it. At once he tried the wrench the ring from his finger and to his fear, it would not move. Panic gripped him. He knew now that this must be one of the famed rings that Sauron had gone to war over in the north. Lagoren could not think what to do and forgetting his nightmares he closed his eyes to think. There, as clear as day was Annatar's face but now warped and twisted into a dreadful visage, it began to laugh: a hateful laugh that pierced his mind like a dagger. Every time he blinked he could see that laughing face. He would run. If Sauron was to drive him insane then he would leave and get far away from any he might harm.\n\nLagoren gathered all provisions he could and left only a simple note to Siwini: "I must go", it read. He would flee west and keep going until he was far out of reach of Sauron. He set off at once and took the swiftest horse from the stables.\n\nLagoren fled into the Neck and after a days ride he came upon the cave where he had once made camp some 20 years prior. At once the calling within him grew unsatiable and he felt his feet disobeying his commands. Off of the horse he walked slowly to the cave, dreading what was to come but unable to turn away. He was surprised to see the cave was empty and he suddenly felt great need to rest. Lagoren lay down and, with fear gripping his heart, he closed his eyes.\n\nLagoren of the Neck was never seen or heard of again and only his horse was ever found. ]]

GAN_ALTAN_BODY = [[Gan Altan was a mighty warrior from the scrublands of Khand. His battle prowess was known throughout the eastern lands and he served any lord, chief, peasant or merchant who could pay in coin. When Sauron’s emissaries spread throughout the east and south, calling all the warriors to arms in wars in the west, Gan Altan and his mercenaries were the first to head take up the call.\n\nThe Elves of Hollin were quick to realize the strength of this strange and outlandish man, for be it on foot or horse, Gan Altan was a force to be feared. His sword drank deep of the blood of his enemies and he was ever in the van of Sauron’s armies. All those of Eriador came to fear his blade: the Windrush. In Khand, fear and terror are often greater weapons than steel or iron and Gan Altan had holes bored into the steel of his blade so that it gave a high pitched wail as it was swung. Gan Altan’s dread aura was enhanced by the trophy like necklace he wore, adorned with the ears of his enemies, Elf ears made for a particularly exotic arrangement and Gan Altan gathered all that he could.\n\nGan Altan’s warrior fame peaked at the battle of the Fords of the Baranduin, in the latter days of the War of Sauron and the Elves. His sword sang gleefully as it sliced through countless foes and Gan Altan laughed as the thrill of battle overcame him. The Elves of Lindon began to fall back against the brutal attack and powerful charges of the Khandish cavalry. They hoped to flee to the relative safety of their last held region - Lindon itself! A few brave souls stayed in the rearguard to buy the retreating forces more time and chief among them was Eruantion. It was rumoured that Eruantion was descended from the house of Fëanor and there were few among the Noldor who could match his skill with the blade. Gan Altan and his guard were the first to start crossing the fords to follow the retreating Elves and in the midst of the river, he and Eruantion met. The river, now running red with blood, crashed into the immoveable feet of the two warriors. "I am Eruantion of the Noldor” he said “and captain to the forces of High King Gil-galad! You may slay me this day but know this: your victories will be short lived! The goodly peoples of Aman will rise and fight against the encroaching darkness!” Gan Altan replied with a great bellowing laugh, "My sword stands ready to send you all to your deaths, be you Elf or Man or Dwarf! Greater deeds must be done this day so let us not tarry Elf!" He charged at Eruantion and his men followed with a mighty war cry. The few guarding Elves fought valiantly but their valour would not win the day. In Eruantion, Gan Altan had finally met a worthy match and the Elf almost had the better of him. Their blades sang as they clashed and the keening of Windrush was piercing to their ears. Eruantion however could not match the raw savagery of this warrior from the east and was undone when Gan Altan allowed the Elf’s sword to tear through his arm in order to gain an opening. With one final ,terrible blow, he cut the head from Eruantion's shoulders. It is said that the cry of Windrush had never sang louder that in that stroke. Gan Altan took the ears of Eruantion and placed them, with pride, in the very middle of his macabre necklace.\n\nAs dawn broke the next day, the sky was a deep red from the blood spilled at the ford but Gan Altan had secured the crossing into Lindon and had paved the way for Sauron’s final attack on the Elves. Gan Altan and his men laughed and feasted in the early morning sun. But, as the sun rose high into the sky, a great dark cloud swept swiftly in from the east and caste all the lands into darkness: the Orc hordes had come. They streamed past Gan Altan’s camp in perfect step and the ground shook at the weight of thousands of heavy feet stamping in unison. At length, the main body of the Orc horde passed over the ford and took to camp. Gan Altan ordered his men be ready to break camp but at the moment, a great fanfare of trumpets and high banners crested the hill behind the camp. The sky seemed to darken time slowed to a crawl as the tall dark figure of the Lord of Shadow appeared atop the hill. Sauron walked slowly but gracefully and came to Gan Altan’s camp. He met the Khandish warrior alone and spoke: "Your legends cannot compare to your deeds, mighty warlord. With your victory you have secured the crossing into Lindon and with that, the gateway to victory. Let it not be said that I do not acknowledge service and skill. I bid you take this ring and with it you will become even mightier in arm and mind. Take it as an honour from me, Tar-‎Mairon, the Lord of Middle-earth, and clear this land of the accursed Elves!" It was all Gan Altan could do in the moment to reach out, take the ring and give a deep bow. He slid the simple band of gold onto his finger and immediately felt a power as he had never before! In the battles that followed, Gan Altan and his riders swept the northern reaches of Eriador like a bloody tide, spreading fear and terror before them. As Sauron had said, Gan Altan became stronger and stronger each day and found himself winning battles with fewer and fewer casualties. He fell countless great warriors, often in a single blow, and laid out battleplans that the greatest captains of the Elves could not predict. With this strength came brutality and he was merciless to his foes, slaughtering all those before him with abandon as Windrush sang its sorrowful song.\n\nSauron’s victory proved to be shortlived in northern Eriador however and as the armies of Mordor came upon the city of Mithlond, the Númenóreans landed in the haven. Gan Altan was not present in the first great battle after their coming but in hearing the stories of the battle, he knew that the tide had turned. The Orcs had been slaughtered to a man. Gan Altan wanted more than a futile death here, far from home and he and his warriors left for Khand.\n\nSauron was utterly defeated in Eriador and he himself vanished, his Orc hordes were slain or routed and even Mordor lay abandoned. Gan Altan returned to the scrublands and deserts of his home and felt weak. He sat in his tent in contemplation. He craved battle. He craved war. He craved blood. "We were weak!" He declared to his people, "That is why the men from the sea defeated us so soundly! We were weak! We must become stronger if we would have our revenge upon them! Ride with me and know battle, become one with battle! Only then can we go back to Eregion and stain its hills and trees and rivers with blood!" And so his warband rode forth and fought against their own. Gan Altan led a bloody campaign against the other Khandish lords to sate his bloodlust: killing and pillaging and desecrating with fury. He didn’t want to unite the clans, he wanted to temper them in battle, show them the power of a true warrior, one honoured by Sauron himself. He wanted to weed weakness out of them and build an army of invincible warriors. But, his violence did not go unanswered and the warlords of Khand united against him: to stop his wanton destruction and slaughter.\n\nGan Altan was a mighty warrior and nigh on unbeatable, but his warband was not. The great battle that followed was short. Gan Altan's warband was outnumbered 30 to 1 and despite their resolve and ferocity, they were easily slain or broken. Gan Altan cursed them for their cowardice and folly and he fought on alone. Try as they might, the warriors of Khand could not beat this man. They fought on and on, always gaining ground but paying for each step gained. In time however, even the mighty Gan Altan could fight no longer as weariness finally took him. Unwilling to die at the hands of these traitors, he fled into the dead lands of Mordor.\n\nNever again would Gan Altan the Honoured come out of the black land, at least, not as the man he once was. As he wandered alone in the bleak wasteland, cursing his comrades and cursing life itself for delivering him to this desolate place, he stumbled across a familiar face coming in from the west. It was Sauron, he could tell from the feeling inside him and the darkening of the sky, but this was not the Sauron who stood proud and tall on the hill in Eregion, this was a spiteful and hateful being in tatty robes. He appeared as an old man, bent from age and weariness and walking with a simple wooden stick. Gan Altan could do no more than stare at this image of Sauron and wonder. After what may have been days, Gan Altan gave a knowing nod to Sauron and fell in behind him. The two then made their way east not to be seen or heard for many years. It was said thereafter in Khandish legends that if you listened hard enough when the wind blew in from the west, you could hear Windrush crying out to the darkened skies. ]]

BALAKNAR_BODY = [[In the past, in lands far to the south, where the stars are different and the sun scorches the earth, where few from Middle-earth have ever ventured, a number of petty kingdoms rose and fell. Among the many, one rose above all others, one who set out to unite the tribes and claim all the lands of Far Harad - daring even to claim the title of "King of Men". This one was Balak'nar Sunfire.\n\nOn the night of his birth, a great comet flashed across the heavens, illuminating the lands as though it were day. The Seers, ever watchful of signs, prophesied that the comet's strength had been given to the boy and he would lead the men of Far Harad to conquest and glory as had never been seen! They said that he, above all others, would live forever.\nA fighter from his early youth, the boy formed a brotherhood of like-minded friends and warriors, earning their respect and love. This fraternity would later become his inner council and each man would swear fealty to Balak'nar in their youth.\n\nBalak'nar's father, Balak'tur, had his own dreams of uniting the tribes of Far Harad however and resolved, in secret, that the comet had been an omen for his destiny and not his son's. When Balak'nar turned 16, his father had already conquered more land and more tribes than any leader had before him. He was hailed as the mightiest of the mighty, chief of chiefs, and Balak'nar was oft forgotten in his father's long shadow. However, the Seers message was clear: it would be Balak'nar not Balak'tur that would live forever.\n\nIn turning his army to the north for the first time, this proved true as Balak'tur came upon the forces of the deserts of Far Harad. Thinking these nomadic peoples weak, he lead his armies openly onto the sands, parading the heads of conquered tribesmen before him. He was given no warning of the poisoned arrow that found his neck shortly after he climbed the first of the great dunes. His lifeless body fell and was consumed by the army rising from the sands. Panic gripped his forces but, without hesitiation, Balak'nar and his loyal fraternity, began giving sharp orders and organised an effective retreat. Within days, despite his young age, Balak'nar took his father's place and cemented his hold on the tribes. Many knew of the Seers prophesy and many had doubted Balak'tur's claims that he was the blessed one. They sided with Balank'nar swiftly.\n\nMany more battles were fought under sun and moon: on the savannas; in the jungles and; on the shifting sands. With each battle, Balak'nar and his captains proved their skill and more and more tribes were brought into the fold. In one battle, with the last of the desert tribes, Balak'nar earned his title of 'Sunfire'. The battle had not gone as easily as many before: these tribesmen were deft hands with the bow and their mastery of the sands was unmatched. As the line of his army began to waiver and break, Balak'nar mounted his horse and, escorted only by his honour guard, he burst through the lines of melee and, against all odds, he made it to the gathered enemy bowmen. As he charged, the sun rose high, its rays catching on his shining armour and outstretched scimitar. It is said the sunlight blinded his enemies and it seemed to all who looked on that Balak'nar was eneveloped in flame. With an almighty roar, he fell upon his foes, as a flame dancing within the fire. Bolstered by this courageous act, and guided by the flaming beacon that was their King, his army turned the tide. Thereafter, rumour spread that the comet itself was borne in Balak'nar and some tribes swore fealty before battle was even joined. Soon, it was done, the empire of Far Harad had risen and at its head stood Balak'nar Sunfire: chief of chiefs, king of kings, Emperor Supreme and the King of all Men.\n\nWith victory achieved, Balak'nar turned to ruling and he proved an able king. Caravans, laden with wealth, began roaming further and further afield , safely and securely thanks to the Empire of Far Harad. The wealth amassed in the south at this time grew significant. Eventually, these traders made their way to the banks of the southern Anduin itself. On their return, they spoke of marvels and wonders of the north. Of fertile lands that prospered under different stars. Balak'nar saw opportunity. More lands to claim and more tribes to conquer. The merchants were quick to warn Balak'nar of a nameless shadow that tainted the north but he paid little heed to this.\n\nOrders were given and his armies mustered. During this time of preperation, a strange company of men came to Balak'nar's camp. They were clad in dark metal armour and all but one had obscured faces. Their leader was tall: taller than most men and he walked with a serene grace as though the earth and all upon it was his. Stopped by the guards, he was asked what business he had with the Sunfire? Smiling warmly, he spoke with a pure and enchanting voice, and said he wanted to see the King of Kings himself and lend his support. Mesmerised, the guards permitted his entry. He came before Balak'nar and spoke of wonders in the north and vast bountiful lands. He knew much and the Sunfire was in awe of this man's presence. Somehow, this stranger knew of growing dissent in the south of Balak'nar's empire: of men who sought to claim power for themselves and tribes who longed to return to their old ways. Mustering the strength to speak, Balak'nar asked who this stranger was. He replied: "you, glorious king, may call me Annatar - in my language it means "lord of gifts" and it is fitting for I bring to you a gift. A ring, bestowed with unimagineable power that will strengthen all that you are. Take it mighty King and lead your people to glory!" Balak'nar eyed the ring hesitantly, and a vision began to take shape in his mind: a man, resplendent in bright, shining, golden armour was leading a mighty army. He could see the banners of this man covered all the land from north to south. It was him. Balak'nar Lord of All. At length, the Sunfire spoke: "You are brave to come to me, armed as you are and escorted by strange warriors but I sense the goodwill of this gift giving. Let it be known that the Sunfire does not turn aside generous offers and tokens of friendship! I will gladly take this ring." WIth that he slipped the ring onto his finger. Annatar smiled and praised Balak'nar's wisdom. He bid the king farewell and as dusk fell, he vanished into the night.\n\nBalak'nar began his campaign as sun rose and with each passing day, he felt stronger and stronger. Wherever he appeared on the field of battle in the days after, his enemies crumbled. He fought furiously, his blade blazing like the fire of the sun both day and night. For many more years he fought and conquered. Yet, as time passed, his behaviour changed. Subtly at first: he became more savage and where before he was merciful and gentle, now he was brutal and swift to kill - as death incarnate. His captains and oldest friends noticed this change and, in secret, they plotted.\n\nBalak'nar's empire now stretched from the deep jungles of the far south to the grasslands of Harondor - a greater extent of conquest in the south had never been, nor ever would be again. It was during the height of his empire's extent that the first uprisings began. The men of the jungles declared themselves free. Balak'nar gave little care to this now. The empire meant nothing to him: there was only battle' only the thrill of the kill and the hunger for more bloodshed. He could find blood to shed everywhere, the south did not matter. His captains now openly questioned his rule. It was their homeland in turmoil, their families, their people. They wanted to put down the rebellion and then return home to live out their days in peace. They petitioned Balak'nar but he was deaf to their cries: now fully ensnared by the ring, he sought only bloodshed.\n\nOne night, his captains came to him and demanded that he return south. Balak'nar saw nothing but mutiny and disloyalty, and exploded into a rage, drew his sword and made for the nearest man. The gathered captains were ready for his reaction but nothing could prepare them for the strength of Balak'nar. Outwardly he was now a short man, bent over despite his young age. His skin was pale and shallow and he rasped for air with every spoken word. Yet, the fire within him burned hotter than ever and he easily overcame his strongest warriors. Terror then gripped his men and it was all they could do to defend themselves. After a few moments of fighting, Balak'nar found himself face to face with Suruk'jii - his oldest friend and second in command. The fear he saw in those eyes froze him in place. The anger and rage flooded from him and he sank to the floor and wept. He was left alone. He could not remember for how long he knelt on the dry floor.\n\nThree days past, news came to Balak'nar that each of his captains had left the army - their companys had gone with them. His force was now less than a third of what it was before. His campaign was brought to a halt but his hunger for blood did not ease. After some months had passed, with the madness taking a hold of him, he resolved that he would return home and put every disloyal commander to the sword. His army turned south and on their march, they burned every town and village to the ground: slaughtering any who stood in their way. Balak'nar's benevolence had turned to hatred and disgust. In time, he made the long journey home and found that rebellion had turned to secession. His captains had divided the south into numerous petty kingdoms and declared themselves as the new kings. These kings had spread word around the empire that Balak'nar had gone mad and was murdering his own people. Thousands abandoned him and, when he finally reached the fringes of southern Haradwaith and looked out at the jungle stretching before him, Balak'nar stood alone. The jungle came alive and an army, numbered in the hundreds of thousands, took shape on the ground before him. It was over. In that moment, he remembered the words Annatar had spoken to him in a time long ago: "beware the fickle nature of men, trust no-one and hold only to yourself." He finally understood the meaning of these words and he gave out a terrible scream - like no sound ever heard in the south - it was shrill and pierced to the very soul of each man.\n\nBalak'nar turned his back on the south and wandered into the desert alone. For many weeks he walked aimlessly. Visions came to him at nightime of a ghostlyworld, devoid of life. In time, something seemed to call to him, a voice from deep within his head. A voice he recognised but could not place: "return to me know" it said. He walked and walked and eventually, now fully overcome with madness of these visions and voices, he came into strange ashen land. In the distance, he could see a great mountain with flames issuing from its peak. Had he died? Stretching out before him was a great lake. The water seemed clear and cool despite the surroundings. He knelt and began to drink. The taste was foul despite the appearance but his thirst seemed unquenchable. Balak'nar felt a presence approach as he drank. He knew before turning who had come. All of a sudden, he knew more than he ever had known, as though a secret door had opened in his mind and untold knowledge was now his. He knew his destiny now: he would indeed live forever. At length, he spoke: "Command me, my Lord Sauron. I am yours." The figure behind him smiled warmly. ]]

SHIVUUS_BODY = [[In a time long passed, when peace covered Middle-earth and the Númenóreans were passing deeper into the darkness, a small boy was born in the harsh and unforgiving land of Harad. On the night of his birth, the moon shone with a fierce and brilliant light, bathing the deserts in a deep silvery glow. His family thus named him Shi, meaning light in the language of the desert-folk. The boy's infancy was marked with miracle: he was walking, talking, reading and writing long before a boy of his age had any right to. His family, having little knowledge of the outside world, thought nothing of it: simply a wonder of nature's many mysteries perhaps?\n\nThey were nomads and, like so many of the desert folk, they followed vast herds of strange beasts from watering hole to watering hole. In their wanderings they covered thousands of miles but rarely did they see another soul. When necessary, Shi's father would make contact with other nomads and the family eeked out a meagre but peaceful existence. As Shi grew, he took to the family's ways with ease and played his part in desert life as his forefathers had done for generations. Little did he know that Shi was nothing like his forefathers.\n\nIt was a cold and biting night. A fierce wind blew up from the south, ripping and tearing at the small tent that housed Shi and his family. Huddled in a corner, they kept together for warmth and longed for the breaking of dawn to bring the desert's heat. As the night drew on, the wind whipped into a storm and the lines of the small tent could no longer hold. Shi's father and brothers rushed out to secure the tent: it was the one lifeline they had, the one wall to hold back the rising storm. After a time, Shi could hear voices rising over the din of the sand whipping against the tent. He broke free of his mother's grasp and went out. He found his brothers clinging to the lines of the tent, struggling to maintain a hold on the canvass as it threatened to fly free. They were calling to their father who was lying in the sand a few paces from the mouth of the tent. Shi dropped to his father's side and looked on in horror as blood spilled from the side of his father's head. An errant branch lay nearby with a crack down its length. The boy was overcome with rage and anger. He held out his hand against the maelstrom of sand and screamed, defiantly, into the night. Then it happened.\n\nA stream of blinding light issued from Shi's hand and took shape: a great and mighty wall of light. The storm broke against the wall and an immediate calm fell on the space behind it. His brother's dropped to their knees in wonder and awe and as the light enveloped each of them, they felt a warmth surge through them. Shi raised his other hand behind him and his father slowly rose into the air, a soft golden light surrounded his limp form but as he rose into the night, the little life in him was rekindled. He felt the wound on his head bind and heal. Gently, he was lowered to the ground and it was all anyone could do to stare at Shi. After a few moment's more, the boy raised both hands above his head and a blinding flash burst up into the sky. The flash rose and rose and then exploded into a million sparks of light. Darkness then fell all around the family but the storm had gone. Shi fell to the sand, unresponsive.\n\nA week passed and Shi awoke in the familiar surroundings of the tent, a gentle breeze lapped at the canvass and felt cool and crisp on his skin. As Shi sat up he realised he was not alone. Sitting only a few feet away was a man; at least he looked like a man but Shi could feel something odd about him. The man had soft and unfamiliar features, his skin was lighter than Shi's and his hair was of a brilliant gold. He stood and had to stoop to avoid the top of the tent. Shi had never seen anyone like him. At length, the man spoke: "Don't be afraid boy. I am here as a guide. I see the surprise in your face, I am not of your land. I come from far beyond the desert sands. I saw the flash of your power not 7 days passed and I have come to help you. There is a power within you that if left unchecked, will consume all that you hold dear. I can help you channel that power and learn to use it. Do not fear the gift you have been given, it is wonderous. With it, you can achieve great things!" Shi was hesitant at first but the man's voice was soothing and fatherly. Shi found trust in this man almost instantly and greeted him warmly. "I would learn all I can from you, if what you say is true. I am Shi and this is my father's tent." he said, "I know your name and the names of your family. You may call me Annatar. I am delighted to meet you Shi."\n\nAnnatar stayed with Shi and his family for a year, wandering the deserts with them. In that time, he showed the boy that what had happened that night was not luck or divine intervention but a raw power that Shi could control. Together, they unlocked the hidden potential that had lain dormant in Shi all his life. Shi took to learning well and quickly mastered the challenges set to him by Annatar. It was not long before he could command this power at will. Alongside a mastery over light, Shi was able to control the sands at will: shifting them into great sculptures and buildings. His family adjusted well to the power of Shi and saw it for the gift that it was.\n\nOne evening, as the family were sharing dinner under the stars, Annatar spoke "My time with you is ended now Shi. I am called away to new lands and new peoples. I would have you remember me and so I present to you this ring. More than just a memory, it will help you to harness your power. Wear it always and think well of Annatar: the lord of gifts. You have surpassed my expectation and I name you anew: Shi-vuus of the Desert Sands "Light Bearer". Farewell." With that, Annatar rose and walked into the night, not to be seen again.\n\nShi recovered well and began using his powers to help his family, their isolation ensured that nobody knew of this powerful boy and Shi stayed in the life of a nomad until his 17th birthday. At that time, he felt that perhaps his gift could be better used out in the world, there must be more to life than the desert sands and so, one morning, Shi said his farewells and left. He headed west were he had known his father used to travel to market in a great city of the deserts. Nothing could prepare the boy for what he saw when he finally arrived at the gates of Faen'obel. The city was a thing of awesome beauty, tall spires stretched high into the sky, defying the laws of the physical world. Great walls encircled the city that seemed to be grown from the earth itself. They were decorated and carved so as to appear as a great line of jungle vines and not of stone. The gates themselves were wrought of a thing that Shi could not place - they seemed as iron but they were light and glided upon their guiding wheels. The size of the city awed Shi, he wandered for a full day and each turn and twist showed him something new: from great market squares to small alley ways, he found he liked the labyrinth of streets far more than the open sands of his youth.\n\nWandering down a particualrly small alleyway that seemed barely big enough for a man to walk at full height, Shi came out into a small clearing between the buildings. It was quiet here and was well screened from the city's main roads. In the corner of the small city glade stood two men. At least, Shi thought they were men, they were clothed in robes of deep blue and their faces were covered with masks. They whispered to one another and as a gentle breeze lapped at their cloaks, Shi could see they each wore an exquisitely crafted sword. The men paid no attention to the boy but Shi was transfixed. There was something about them that called to Shi. He approached and each man fell silent but they did not turn to look. As Shi reached out his hand - in a greeting that was common amongst the nomads - the men leaped upon Shi. They moved with a lightning speed and with such grace that, were Shi not now on his knees with sword at his throat and chest, he would have clapped. "What business have you with us boy. Speak carefully for your life is worth nothing to me." "I am Shi-vuus, the Desert Sand, I am a traveller and though I travel unarmed, think not that I am helpless." With that, Shi gave a slight nod and the earth beneath their feet began to rent and undulated. The men sprang back but as they touched the ground again, it swallowed them to their waists. Shi stood and laughed. "Tell me your names and perhaps I will let you leave this place." he said. "I am Lakh and the one behind me is Sukh." one of the men said. "What is your business in the city Lakh?" asked Shi "We are here to make coin." they said "well, there doesn't seem to be much coin in this alleyway, and your garb - I may be young but I know much that you could not imagine. You are not merchants." The two men looked at each other and made strange motions with their heads, Shi could see that they blinked in patterns and was amazed to realise they were speaking to one another but through gesture and signs. At length, Sukh spoke: "we are here to earn coin by saving this city. The man who rules this city and sits in the Black Palace is a tyrant and a murderer. His soldiers scour the lands up and down the great river and he enslaves the people under his crazed will. We have been tasked with ending him and for this, we will be handsomely rewarded. If you help us, you can share in our coin. What say you?" Shi thought for a moment and considered their proposal. He had not set out to claim lives with his power but Annatar had taught him that a little evil can serve a greater good. "I will help he said." He stamped his foot and the two men rose from the sand.\n\nThat night, the three assassins set out on their grim task. The Black Palace was encircled by a great wall and there was only a single gate but, with Shi's help, any stone or earthen wall could just as easily be a door and the three men made it into the heart of the palace without disturbing a soul. In only a short time, they found themselves standing in the bedchamber of High King Nuron - the self-proclaimed ruler of Harad. The king slept soundly in the bed at the centre of the vast room but he was not alone. Encircling his bed was nealry 40 bowing women. Each one facing towards the bed and unmoving in their deep graceful bows. Apart from this strange entourage, the king had seemingly no guards posted inside the room. Lakh and Sukh "spoke" to one another in their silent gestures and then Lakh said: "we cannot get to him without alerting those women. They are more than they seem and we cannot risk their ire. We need your help." Shi understood, "close your eyes" he said and he silently sat on the floor and closed his, after a few moments he began to rise into the air and then, suddenly, an almighty flash ripped at the heart of the room. Within seconds, each and every bowing women fell to the ground, their faces twisted and warped as though frozen in a deep agony. Nuron was woken by the flash and the sound of his guards falling and he went to scream but before he could, a blade tore through the silence of the room and he drooped against the headboard. It was done.\n\nLakh and Sukh then lead Shi out of the city, using his help, and they met with a dark and shadowed figure a few miles from the city gate. They nodded to him and he dropped a large bag on the floor and rode into the night. The three assassins then made their way into the desert. They walked for two days until eventually Shi could see small spires rising from the top of a tall and jagged rock formation. "We are home" Lakh said. "Welcome to Tal-Hash." Shi was not sure what he was seeing, at first it seemed as though a great rock had been dumped in the desert but as they drew nearer, windows and doors appeared in the rock face. It was a fortress - carved out of the rock itself! They lead Shi through a labyrinth of sheer rock walls until they entered a simple wooden door. Shi found himself in a great inner chamber, the walls were of polished stone and the air was cool. The room was filled with many men and women garbed in the same blue robes as Lakh and Sukh. Shi was ushered to the front of the room were a tall hooded figure was standing silently. "I am Grand Master Halakrim. Welcome to Tal-Hash, Shi-vuus. I have heard of your powers and your exploits in Faen'obel. We have gathered here to have you join us. We are the Hasharii." Shi stood silently and gazed out to realise that all the gathered assassins were kneeling before him. Halakrim spoke: "the prophesy is now complete - the wandering boy, born of the desert sands, now stands in the halls of Tal-Hash. It is your destiny, Shi, to lead this order to greatness." With that, Halakrim threw back his hood and knelt before Shi as well. Shi felt his power rise in him as though it was accepting this honour. He could not quite understand why but something within him told him that this was his destiny and that he must accept. "I will lead you." he said.\n\nIn the years that followed, Shi-vuus honed his power and prowess with the Hasharii. he accompanied them on their shadowy dealings and within only a short time, he had shown his aptitude for their work. He found that he relished in the task. Where before he gawked at the idea of killing another, his mind now always found reasons for their deaths: this one was a torturer; that one was a tyrant; this family helped shelter a known murderer; that town had been enslaving nearby villages. He feel deeper and deeper into the ways of the Hasharii and after some years, he no longer cared who his tragets were. He didn't care for the coin either, he relished the kill, he lived for it. Shi found ever more dark and distrubing uses for his powers and his began to draw his kills out. To take pleasure in the hunt. To Shi that was all their was. Whenever his mind doubted his actions or balked at what he had become, another voice rose in counterance and silenced his doubts.\n\nIt was not long before Shi's name was known throughout all Harad: Shi-vuus, the desert sand.\n\nFor many more years, Shi lead the Hasharii to greatness, as was foretold. He outlived many of his brothers and sisters but at a great price. By the time Shi turned 50, his body had become a twisted and sallow thing - his ribs were marked on his chest and his breathing was slow and laboured. His legs creaked and groaned with each step and he walked bent over and with the aid of a stick. Yet, when he commanded the power that ran through him, he moved with an elegant grace and was deft on his step - as unstoppable in combat as he had ever been. His mind was clear however and ever did the lust for killing call to him but he never raised a blade against the Hasharii.\n\nIt was a cold and biting night that Shi's destiny would finally be fulfilled. He sat in his private chamber, preparing for another raid to satiate his hunger when there was a knock on the door. Shi opened the door with a slide of his foot and ushered his servant in. A shadow loomed over his table and he grew irritable at the silence: "what is it Deneb?" he said. "I am not Deneb and I see that you are no longer the Shi I knew in the shifting sands." Shi whirled in place and found himself staring into familiar eyes. "Annatar?" he asked. "Ah yes, Annatar. I have not used that name now for many years. You may call me as I call myself: Sauron, Lord of All." Shi felt an uncontrollable need to bow and at once he fell to his knees. "I see you have worn my ring as I asked and with it, you have achieved great things. Such wonderous and terrible things! You have served me in life well Shi and I am here to reward you again." "You have already richly rewarded me my Lord. What service have I offered you that I am worthy of more?" "Ah Shi, you have spread fear and terror in the lands of the south, you put down a King who threatened my power and you have honed your skills as a warrior in preperation for your tasks to come. Yes, you have served me very well." Shi was baffled: "tasks to come my lord?" he asked. "Yes Shi, you have served me in your life and now, I give to you the gift of unending life so that you may serve me in all the long lives to come." Sauron turned and left but not before resting his hand on Shi' withered shoulder.\n\nThe man that had lived Shi-vuus, the desert sand, died in that room that night and when Deneb came upon the room with supper some time later, he found only his masters old cloak, crumpled on the floor. ]]

AGLARAKHOR_BODY = [[The King's justice. Númenor's ancient law. Teachings past on from the days of Elros half-Elven, and the ravages of the war of wrath.\n"Covet not for power, yearn not west across the sea.\nGive aid to those beneath you, and do not from duty flee.\nYou lords among men, raised as kings above all.\nStray not from the woven path, be wary of temptation's call."\n\nAglarâkhôr was in the closing years of his teens, right as Númenórean boys shed the innocence of their childhood, reaching for the sceptre of the kings of men. But it was already many years ago that the young lordling had taken to questioning Illúvatar, hiding himself from prying eyes. His father had found him, reading dark texts by candlelight. He was sent away.\n\nRaised among the loremasters around the peak of Meneltarma, Aglarâkhôr endured harsh education, atonement for his sins. Secretly he carried bitterness towards his father, the loremasters, and all those who cheerfully hailed Illúvatar's themes. Harnessing his resentment until finally he resolved to never again name the Valar in honour, and to free his people from the tyranny of their “light”, though he envisioned little mercy for those refusing to see the injustice of their overlords.\n\nFinally reaching his coming of age, on his fiftieth name-day,Aglarâkhôr was released from the cloisters and libraries around the sacred mountain. But he never returned to the dwellings of his house. Travelling the Blessed Isle he witnessed the burning of loremasters of the Dark, alchemists and sorcerers dabbling in matters which the Eldar would advise against. He saw heretics crucified on tall trees, as their families were made to watch. For even though the Númenóreans fancied themselves Elf-friends, closer in kinship to the Eldar than to the men living under the sway of darkness in Middle-earth, mortal men they remained, being susceptible to the taint that Morgoth had laid upon the world. And to them the judgements spoken in the Halls of Mandos seemed an endless struggle, their meaning lost in men's eagerness to follow them.\n\nBoth in the splendour of the priesthood and the royal line, as well as among the poverty of the common folk, there were the signs of corruption, made all too apparent by their hunt for those who spoke out against it. Aglarâkhôr met like-minded people in secret councils throughout Númenor's cities. In these meetings he met him who would hold sway over his heart until the end of his days, chief-herald to the hidden parties sworn to the end of the rule of Valinor, Berôkar the Fair.\n\nHis eyes a golden shine, the stars kindled in his flowing hair, with face kind and garments fair. He spoke to Aglarâkhôr as to an old friend: "Hail, and welcome!" Berôkar's smile was a summer's eve, kind and warm, yet with a foreboding promise of indulgent reward, and mischievous fun. Aglarâkhôr was awestruck, for Berôkar spoke words both kind and wise. Many had tales to tell both more tragic and less than Aglarâkhôr, but when he told about his fortunes Berôkar took his hands. Sadness was in his kind eyes, "Alas that the cruelty of the Valar bring such fates to the men of this land, but here at least you are among friends." Then he embraced Aglarâkhôr, and Aglarâkhôr felt for the first time in many years love born from compassion and kindness.\n\nMuch anger was harboured by Aglarâkhôr and the other men of the council, but Berôkar spoke understanding and comfort. Aglarâkhôr sat with him for long hours into the night, or walked in the gardens of the fair city of Armenelos, for here the presence of philosophers sanctioned by the King offered them some shelter from the strict judgements of Illúvatars law. Among Berôkar's secret society there was particularly much anger among those merchants and sailors who above all wanted free reign to go about their pursuits in Middle-earth, but who's business was impeded upon by the impractical moralities dictated by the loremasters of Meneltarma. To them Berôkar spoke: "Indeed does Illúvatar sanction little free will upon his subjects, yet while the mariners of the King still patrol the seas in the name of the Elf-lords, I council that you avoid the havens of the Eldar, and sail rather to the lands further south and east. Men are friendly there, and will welcome your trade more readily."\n\nSome of the council were indeed men of great power and standing among the noble houses of Númenor, who found their policies influenced by Elven messengers. Plans and strategies were passed down from father to son under the supervision of Elven councillors sworn to the noble households, to serve ends who they themselves could not comprehend within the span of their lives. "I worry for the future of my children and my children's children. For to what end the plans of the eldar will bring them I cannot say. Is there no way to lengthen our time in this world, and so have a more equal say in these matters that are our concern more than any other's?"\n\nTo them Berôkar spoke: "Eru's gift to his first-born is a fine one indeed, surely granted to them so that they can guide you, subtly executing their policies over the long years to keep their rule hidden from you. You are right to seek ways to broaden your perspective over the ages, for even now there are previous events that shaped the fate of the world, that are kept secret from you. Much grief was there when the overlords of the West came across the sea and bought victory for their master at great cost, and the truth of what happened then is now known only to a few. But in this matter above all I council prudence, for the might of the Valar is a power that cannot be easily overcome. The secret of everlasting life is their most precious treasure, and in delving into these matters you are sure to awaken their ire."\n\nIn those days the royal court was an open forum, for Tar-Atanamir, king of Númenor, was a ruler both wise and radical, seeking ever to broaden the debate of his councils. The king invited to his court scholars and philosophers from all the lands of the world, and provided Berôkar and his followers asylum to openly discuss the Law of the Valar. Great strife was there between Berôkar's disciples and the loremasters of Meneltarma, Aglarâkhôr was ever at the forefront of the debate: "Peace and love, reconciliation and justice, these you say are the chief values that the One would have us embrace. But by the deeds made in his name I know them little. If He loves us so, why will he have us prosecute each other so harshly in his name? Why does he meddle in the ways that we choose to embrace these values?" And the loremaster of Illúvatar answered: "We men are ever burdened by the temptations of our own hubris. Is it not then our duty to enforce His policies according to the circumstances that we live in? Illúvatar's hand is a gentle one, and so it is left to us to live our lives by his virtues on our own accord. Even though we live on this blessed island near the neverdying lands beyond the sun, we still carry with us the taint of darkness. Why should we burden our benevolent Father with the judgements of our mistakes? Is it not right that we ourselves should take responsibility for our sins?"\n\nThat evening Berôkar took Aglarâkhôr aside. "You are wise and far-seeing, indeed one of the great leaders that will spread the truth about the oppression Valar across all the reaches of the land. But the men of this island are dogged. So entrenched in the teachings forced upon them that they would rather die than see reason. As such I bid you be my chief emissary, and teach them to see how they have been mislead." At this Aglarâkhôr was dismayed, for he had seen the harsh prosecution that awaited those who spoke out against the Valar outside the capital. He answered: "I wish nothing more than to aid you in our quest, and to guide our people to be free to pursue their own destinies. But I do not know if I have the strength, for though our reason are sound and just, Illúvatar's subjects will not hear it." Then Berôkar placed his hand upon Aglarâkhôr's face, and in that moment it was as if all doubt vanished, leaving only hope and prospect. Berôkar said: "I have come to know the strength of your will, and I know that it will never be broken as long as you hold true to your purpose. Yet if your spirit wavers, I will support you, holding you always in my heart, even as we are far apart." Berôkar reached for his pocket. Holding his hand out he produced for Aglarâkhôr, a ring, forged in rich gold, set with a red jewel. "To this end I bid you take this token, and if while wearing it you think of me, I will know it, and I will come to aid you in spirit." And when Aglarâkhôr put it on his finger it was as if Berôkar's hands rested upon his shoulders, whispering comfort gently in his ear, even as he rode out of Armenelos to rally the people of Númenor in oposition to the Valar.\n\nLong and hard was his labour, but Aglarâkhôr found himself shielded from weariness. Wherever he went he persuaded men to his reasoning. Lore masters and soldiers, lords and peasants, all heard his voice and were enthralled by the promise of prosperity and greatness, free of the law of the Valar, even questioning their Ban, sailors urging to explore the seas far west of the coast.\n\nYet as the years lengthened and the word spread, so to did the corruption that ever will be a part of the hearts of men. Even as the men of Númenor threw down their shackles and renounced the Valar, even so did they fall into deeds of greed and pettiness, and those who had not yet been convinced of their rebellion were hunted. Aglarâkhôr vanished from the island of Númenor, to where none can say, but some say that he ventured with Berôkar and still resides with him, aiding him in opposing the rule of the Lords of the West. ]]

ZAGAR_BODY = [[The man who would become Zagar, the feared Blade of Sauron, was born in S.A. 1656 in the city of Andúnië upon the isle of Númenor. His parents, among the most devoted of the city’s Faithful, named their newborn child Nimruzir – “Elf-friend”. Throughout the days of his youth, Nimruzir came to love and admire the Elves just as his family did, seeing them constantly in the streets and port of Andúnië. As his father would often invite travelling Elves to dine with his family, Nimruzir grew up listening to their tales, and was awed by their wisdom and the long ages that so many had experienced. When word reached Númenor of Sauron’s invasion of Eriador and the fall of Eregion, Nimruzir’s father journeyed with the Lord of Andúnië to Armenelos in order to petition King Tar-Minastir to aid Gil-galad and the Elves. This force was finally assembled, and Nimruzir rallied to the call along with his father, brother, and numerous others of his friends and family. The great war that followed ended in victory, of course, and Nimruzir played his own valiant part in it. Near Lond Daer, he led an advanced force that held a vital bridge for hours against overwhelming numbers, and at the decisive Battle of the Gwathlo, Nimruzir led one of the key charges that finally shattered the enemy ranks and sent the Orcs fleeing. However, even such victories were not without cost, and Nimruzir suffered more than his share of grief as his close friends and family members fell one by one during the campaign. The most grievous blow came at the Gwathlo, where Nimruzir’s brother fell to an orcish arrow just on the cusp of victory, eventually dying in his arms. When all was finished, only Nimruzir and his father remained of their close companions and kin to join the sadly reduced force sailing home. As the Númenoreans returned victorious, so many reveled in what they had won, but Nimruzir could think only of all that he had lost. Why had his friends and family sailed so far from home, and what had they truly gained that was worth the lives the war had ended? Nimruzir could find neither peace nor closure from these questions, but only a growing anger. In the months and years that followed, Nimruzir found he could no longer even look upon an Elf without thinking of those he had lost fighting to aid them. His father noticed the change, but any efforts to confront Nimruzir led only to greater anger. “Why should we have spilled our own blood to defend the Elves from their own follies? What do they care of us, when our lives are but a flicker before their eyes anyway? We give our lives to preserve theirs, yet still they deny us the eternal life of the West!”\n\nThen, one night, as he stormed away from yet another argument with his father, Nimruzir heard a low voice behind him. “Those of short horizons will never heed you.” Nimruzir whirled in a rage, to find a tall hooded figure step out of the blackness. “Who are you? Why are you following me?” “You may call me Dolgukhôr,” the figure replied, lowering his hood as he did so. “I am here because I can grant you that which you have craved for years. That which the Elves cannot give, that which the Valar dare not give, though you are no less worthy than they. I, and I alone of the powers of this world, can grant you eternal life.” Nimruzir had taken Dolgukhôr at first for simply a fellow Man of Númenor, but as he had spoken these astonishing words, his air had changed as well. It was as though Dolgukhôr had lowered the hood from not just his face, but his essence as well. The more he spoke, the more he seemed to reveal a hidden power that Nimruzir had ever seen in any ordinary Man, or even any Elf he had encountered, until finally Dolgukhôr smiled. “Take this, and claim your greatest desire,” he said, holding out an open hand to reveal a ring. “Put aside the cruel ‘gift’ bestowed upon all Men, and accept mine instead. Merely put on this ring, and live on. Live on for all the lives lost by the follies of others, live on for all the life cruelly denied, and live on to take the eternal lives of those unworthy to possess them.” Thus he tipped the ring into Nimruzir’s palm, turned, and vanished into the night. Nimruzir studied the ring, a simple golden circle of seemingly ordinary craft, but set with a small gem so black that it seemed to drink in the night around it. And as he held it, Nimruzir found that the ring was not merely cold to the touch, but a wheel of ice in his palm so bitter that it seemed almost to burn. His first reflex was to drop it, but he found that his hand seemed unable to summon the will to turn over. At last, seemingly of their own will, his fingers slowly closed around the ring, and he slipped it into a pocket. Yet for all its seeming power, Nimruzir could not forget its ominous bone-chilling cold. Over the following weeks, he kept the ring with him, but could not quite bring himself to actually wear it.\n\nFinally, one dark night, Nimruzir was sitting at his table staring at the ring laid out in front of him, when suddenly the door burst open to reveal his father. Nimruzir snatched up the ring, but not quickly enough, and his father demanded to see what he held. As Nimruzir slowly opened his hand, his father reached out questioningly to examine the ring within. Yet as his fingers touched it, both Nimruzir and his father felt a jolt of cold run through their hands, and Nimruzir saw the look on his father’s face change from curiosity to horror. “My son, I do not know where this ring came from, but it cannot be anything good. Surely this can only be the work of a great evil such as we fought in Eriador, such as our people have fought for an Age. Throw it away now, or you will be lost forever!” And when Nimruzir found himself hesitating, his father leapt forward to snatch the ring from him. At that moment, Nimruzir felt a shadow pass between the two of them. The ring had been bestowed on him alone; only an enemy would try to wrest it from him. Nimruzir fought back, and though his father struggled fiercely to pry open his fingers, Nimruzir grabbed a dagger from the nearby table and drove it through his father’s throat. As Nimruzir sat transfixed with horror at what he had done, a familiar low voice spoke behind him, “You did not kill him. His own folly killed him, just as the follies of the Elves killed so many whom you held dear.” Nimruzir turned wordlessly toward the voice. Dolgukhôr continued, “Your blade has thwarted one who would steal your birthright from you. Now become the blade that thwarts those who would steal my birthright. You need only claim, at last, the power I have gifted you.” And at last, the man who had been “Elf-friend” discarded his old name and the tenets of the Faithful, and slipped the cold golden ring onto his finger. He and Dolgukhôr escaped Númenor that night by ship, throwing off pursuit by first sailing west just beyond the limits of the Ban of the Valar. And in the centuries that followed, all of Middle-earth would come to know the terror of Zagar, the Blade who brought the cold hand of death to all whose follies led them to oppose the Dark Lord Sauron. ]]

Whilst his past is shrouded in mystery, his military prowess is not: Khamûl is a horsemaster. He posesses a control over the beasts that rivals the lords of Rohan and Khand. This has given rise to the belief that he must be a descendant of the northmen for surely none but them can tame and master horses the way Khamûl does. ]]

The commander pointed out how coincidental it was that they now seek peace after their armies have been defeated. At that, the chieftains dropped to their knees and as one they gave an oath of fealty to the "King of all Arnor". Each man then took out a knife, made a cut across their arm and sealed their oath in blood.\n\nTwo days later, hundreds of Rhudaurans then flooded into the towns and villages on the border with Rhudaur and pledged allegiance.

Allow me a demonstration!”\n\nThe crowd before the king muttered- strange deals with even stranger wizards seemed unwise, and yet Yagthák was clearly convinced. There were rumours that the White Wizard could pervert the mind and will of men- had their king fallen to his foul whispers? Yet, Yagthak pulled from his cloak a strange weapon- a crossbow. He aimed it, and with a solid thunk, a bolt landed into one of the wooden posts supporting the hall of the High-Brenin's Roost. The crossbow was a dangerous weapon- while apparently more common in legends of the far and strange lands of the east, they had only ever heard of the dwarves using such weapons in Middle-Earth. If they could produce them, they could deal a heavy blow to the Rohirrim. And after allowing them to consider the implications, Yagthák continued.\n\n“Saruman gave us that weapon, and the knowledge to reproduce it. Even now, I’ve made orders for them to be reproduced in mass for the King’s Warband. They are not as fine or as deadly as those of the dwarves, and they are a bastard to craft, so we cannot equip every man with one, but this is proof of his friendship! Imagine the blows we can deal to the Strawheads! We have few friends, and he asks nothing that we would not otherwise give in exchange for his friendship. All he asks us for the moment is to prove our might by conquering and consolidating out power, and he promises us further aid if we can show we are worthy. We have fifteen years even and he grants us gold to help us support our war! I will see us once again rule in Edoras!”\n\nYet, Saruman’s offer seemed too good to be true. The two leaders of the Wulfguard- Taraghlan and Glírhuin, the most powerful of the hereditary body of powerful Dunlending nobles and brenins alike who advised the king, had their doubts too. And yet, if Yagthák could prove his might, perhaps they could be convinced to take the field. Perhaps foolishly, Yagthák also accepted another offer of Saruman- a personal bodyguard composed of Orthanc Guard. While they were very fine, and very capable guards who were supremely skilled in battle, there was much doubt and distrust over this decision to entrust his safety to men sworn to the White Wizard instead of his own retainers. The king was taking a gamble. How would we expand? Would we face Rohan directly first or turn instead to expand our might by crushing and conquering our weak willed kin in Enedwaith and using their resources to prepare for our war with Rohan? If he could pull this off, he would be remembered as another Wulf, finding a friend in the White Wizard as Wulf found friends in the corsairs who aided him in conquering Rohan, but if it failed… What price would Dunland pay?\n\nTO CONTINUE THE SCRIPT, 8 REGIONS MUST BE HELD BY DUNLAND BY TURN 80 ]]

Long have we served as guardians of Alfcud and the Clanmoot itself- and now once again does one of our own, our Cheftain Tremac, serve as the Speaker of the Moot. And yet, times have never been more dire. The Clans of Enedwaith are now beset on all side by foes with few friends in this world and there are whispers of the Shadow mustering its strength in the far east. Our traditional rivals for the Speaker’s position, the Liadan, have abandoned the Clans and now crouch behind the walls of Lond Daer. To the east our warlike kin in Dunland are used as pawns by the White Wizard and once again march against us. To the northeast there are rumours of growing powers within the Misty Mountains, and refugees from Rohan speak of outright war beween Isengard and Edoras.\n\nBefore we can turn our attention to those threats we must deal with matters at home for the Clans stand at a nadir. Bandits, usurpers and traitors have overtaken the ancestral Clanseats of our fellow clans and only Alcfud is still held by the peoples of this land. As expected, the Clanmoot has long been in debate with each clan arguing that their home should be reclaimed first. Finally, however, a decision has been made on these matters. The Speaker, Tremac, shall be authorised to command the full might of the clans and has been tasked with reclaiming all of our lands - one-by-one. To assist, the secretive and respected Dubhsìthe Dönáidh has conveyed the approval of his order and will fight with us personally! The other cheftains cannot fight with us as their time is consumed by managing the effects of this great turmoil upon their clans - many people have been displaced and many livelihoods lie in ruin. The chieftain of the Fylani however, ever ready for battle and bloodshed, has issued us a challenge: should we reclaim the seat of the Fylani (The ancient Dúnedain castle of Argond) then he will personally lead his honour-guard into the field.\n\nSadly therefore the vast majority of the clans can only aid us indirectly for the moment but as we construct various industries befitting each clan then they will call forth their levies to fight. Furthermore, the reclamation of each Clanseat will allow us to call on the support of the elders of each clan as their stores of arms and armour are returned to them and housed in bespoke muster grounds. In time, the foolishness of the Liadan must also be seen to and they must be made to face reason or perish. Although no clan calls the barren lands of Saralainn and Larfearann home, we must also reclaim them to secure our borders.\n\nFinally, the threat of Dunland must also be addressed. Our wayward kin have sworn themselves fully to the White Wizard, preferring to seek vengence for the crimes of the past rather than look to the future. Labelling us as weak-willed fools, they would rather die in battle than seek a peaceful reconciliation with us. Our only option will be to defeat them in the battle they crave, and show them the proof of our conviction. We are confident however, that many peaceful Dunlendings, ostracized on account of their forgiving natures, will join us if we establish our muster grounds in their lands.\n\nOnce these threats have been dealt with, then shall we turn our attention to the future, whatever that may be. The reclamation must come first.\n\nTO PROGRESS, THE FOLLOWING REGIONS MUST BE UNITED UNDER ENEDWAITH’S BANNER: LUGIU, MAOLFINN, ANGREN BAY, MAOLRUNAIDH, HEOROTSCIR, LARFEARANN, CALADIR, ERYN VORN, SARALAINN, CAIRILL, DUNLAND LOWLANDS, DUNLAND BORDER AND DUNLAND PROPER. ]]

The formidable infrastructure of Lond Daer is also a prize- while some was damaged during the battle, much remains intact and will be of great aid to our mission.\n\nAs for the treasonous Dubhsìthe who were serving the prior chieftain, it has emerged that they were a rebel group who saw the Liadan’s cause as the more just one. The new chieftain has now told us that his clan embarked upon their cause as they feared any association with their kin would taint them in the eyes of foreign lords and poison any attempt at equal parley. Thus, did they claim independence from the clans and sought to garb themselves as haughty lords. Many disagreed in the clan, rightly seeing disunity would only lead to weakness and destruction, but still, there is some truth to those words.

Faced with this, they turned cloak to us to preserve their culture. The Faolan are overjoyed- with this reclamation, they can resume their raids into Dunland, and prove their name as the wolves of Enedwaith.\n\nIn fact, their leader, Melmidoc, has been so impressed with our efforts that he has pledged to leave the day to day governing of his clan to another, and join us personally to render military aid as a general. Furthermore, the reclamation of their clanseat will also allow us to marshal Faolan warriors from the mustering grounds of the Clanmoot.

Although the damage may be great, and the forest has many new scars, it will heal in time as long as we maintain our watch over it. As for the Dubhsìthe, they are overjoyed to have their home back, and resume their devotions within their Great Circle.\n\nA mysterious people, they have long served as guides to all the clans of Enedwaith, never taking a seat upon the Clanmoot, but standing apart as mediators, emissaries and in times of strife as assassins. Within their ranks are the lost and forsaken, for to join them is to forsake one’s own clan and swear an oath of loyalty to the forest itself, an oath that is only broken by death. It is said they began as the shattered remnants of the Second House of the Edain, our distant kin, who fled to our lands long ago. Ever since, they have used their lore in service of the forest, perhaps to atone for the crimes that their kin, the First and Second Houses, committed against it. Now, we can fully muster this formidable force of both men and women, inspiring our own forces and sowing fear within the ranks of the enemy. ]]

Long held by Dunland, it has been left neglected and ruined- once a proud town, it is but a shadow of its former self. It mirrors the Mordag themselves- they are said to have defended our capital of eld against the Númenóreans when few others would, and many of them gave their lives in that siege. In recompense, the Númenóreans enslaved those who remained and crushed their traditions and stories- working their elders to the death and separating the young. After the occupation, those proud warriors fell, becoming either fishers scraping a living along the rainswept coast or raiders preying upon the innocent. It is them whom gave rise to the image of our clans as savage javelin wielding raiders. Yet we have ourselves to blame partly for this- after all, Dunland held their home for hundreds of years, and we dismissed them as bitter raiders too, doing nothing while we prospered. Their fishermen’s service to us in battle have shown us how mistaken we were- it is time to change this.\n\nTheir grizzled chieftain, Fiönghan, has met our proposal with hope in his eyes, and although still bitter, he has agreed to it once we admitted our own wrongs- we shall establish a professional corps of Mordag javelinists in the hopes that this will give them a cause to fight for more noble than raiding. Standing proudly with belief in this idea, he forgave us despite our years of inaction, convinced this would restore his clans’ pride in themselves. He was so uplifted that he has even agreed to lead the first company to prove they can serve just as well as any other.

A strange clan, it is said that they were nobles before the sack of Athámor- upon which, they fled to their kin within the Drúadan Forest, and this changed them. From nobles, they became hunters, stalking through the forest, although the leadership of their clan remains hereditary. Although their chieftain has never served as the Speaker of the Moot, their voice bears the most influence on account of their nobility. It was them who were responsible for convincing the other clans to agree to our mission of reclamation, albeit only when their own home fell.\n\nHowever, no further Keefei aside from their hunters will aid us- they claim they have other responsibilities more important than mere combat. Nevertheless, they have agreed to convince their kin in the Drúadan Forest to aid us. The Druedain are a fearsome force, wielding poisoned arrows and are adept at stealth. This is a boon we should be most grateful for, as they rarely lend their aid to other men. Even now a small contingent marches to aid us led by their famed cheftain, Ghân-buri-Ghân! ]]
FYLANI_RECLAIMED_TITLE = [[The Fylani Ride out! ]]
FYLANI_RECLAIMED_BODY = [[Far away Argond once again can count the Clanmoot as its friend. Taken by a crafty group of bandits decades ago, the Fylani abandoned it to them, reasoning that the castle was not worth an extensive siege and loss of life. After all, they lead a nomadic life on the northern plains, and had little need for the castle, and little ties to it, for they only migrated from their original homeland in the Gap of Rohan three hundred years ago, during the era of Wulf. This abandonment of their clanseat added to the accusations by other clans that they were not a true clan, and were mongrels of mixed blood. As such, they are overjoyed to have it back and their herders stand tall for with their armed service, they have shown they are as much of a clansman as any and have as much love for our land as even the eldest clans.\n\nFurthermore, with access to their workshops, they are once again able to produce the feared and famed war wagons that they gifted to the Clanmoot long ago in gratitude for their formal seat upon it. Their chieftain, Coruion, even now rides upon one for he is glad to aid us now that we have proven our own worth and leadership by leading the reclamation of their home. With these war wagons, we shall show the world that they should not be so quick to dismiss us! ]]
ENEDWAITH_UNITED_BODY = [[It is done- at long last do the eight chieftains of the clans sit once again around the Clanmoot. Much struggle has brought us to this point- against bandits, Dunland and even our own kin. Now we are secured however and can stand firm, with our kin in Dunland posing little threat now that their heartlands are ours and we have proved the depths of our conviction. We have not only united our clans but have also united them with our warlike kin of Dunland. It is now time to decide our future.\n\nThe meeting began at peace- there was much gladness at first, but the tension rose when it came to address the oliphant in the room- where to from here? Ansgar of the Keefei broke the silence- “It is done- I see no reason to linger. We have our own lands to administer, and I see no reason to continue to allow the Mocháini to lead a united military when the mission of reclamation has been fulfilled. Surely, we can return to the norm, wherein each clan can be responsible for its own affairs?” An uproar accompanied his words- the chieftain of the Mordag protested- “How rich! You call into other clans when it is your home that is in danger, but once the job is done, you are quite happy to remove that which was keeping the rest of us safe! This unified force is giving my clan pride- I shall not suffer you to take it from me!”\nIt seemed certain that it would not end well as the uproar continued and clans began to align themselves before either side- it would only take one misplaced word or blow for conflict to erupt. And then, there was a thud and Ansgar fell to the floor, an arrow marking his forehead. The black arrow of the Dubhsìthe.\n\nAnd she stepped forward, Aife, Donncháidh’s superior and the leader of that order. “Cease your bickering. That man wanted nothing but to create conflict- we have found evidence from the Keefei hunters that while they hunted for their food, their leaders feasted. The source of that wealth has become clear- it was not bought by the devotion of their kin to them, but by the tainted coin of the White Wizard. Yes! The Keefei have been accepting bribes all along to stir chaos- the fallen one wished for them to create weakness so that Dunland could prey on us all. That was why they did not argue for reclamation till their own home fell by happenstance to bandits- this latest attempt at urging you to abandon your newfound unity was a paltry attempt to win back into his good graces. We, however, will not urge or manipulate you- our oath compels us to stand alongside you, but never with you. We have hence removed the taint from this council- any decision must now be your own. As for the Keefei- the remaining leaders should fall into line lest they wish to follow Ansgar.” And with this, she withdrew leaving a terrible silence.\n\nThe Liadan Chieftain was the first to speak- “I am aware of my clan’s sins. But I must speak, nevertheless. If the White Wizard wishes us to splinter apart, I say we give him the opposite! He should gaze upon us, unified!” The Faolan chieftain then rose- “I concur, and I can speak for our kin in Dunland who have joined with us. And I would go a step further- although the methods of the Liadan may have been wrong in casting off that which makes defines us, we can neither no longer remain scattered clans. I say it is time to gather under one banner as our kin in Dunland did, but without the cruelty that marked their unification.”\nThe Báirseach chieftain agreed- “If we wish to stand equal in matters of trade, arms and parley to our neighbours, then we must appear equal. There must be a single authority, rather than disparate clans.” The Fylani’s chieftain rose- “But I think I speak for all when I say it must not be a king- this council must be that authority, with all having a voice. Lest some are discarded as mongrels and outcasts and left to rot. Let this council rule, not only in times of strife, but in all matters.” A Keefei hunter also spoke up- “I can speak for my people- we would be most proud to join with you. Us hunters, who have given our lives and will continue to give them for this dream. The Keefei stand with you!”\n\nThe Mordag’s leader spoke again, “Hunters, you do your clan honour, showing true nobility. Who are we to refuse? At last my people have something to be proud of once again! I say however, let not this city serve as our seat- it will bring to mind nought by memories of bickering clansmen. I propose a bold venture- I propose that we reclaim our capital of eld, Athámor! The Keefei’s ignoble rulers would argue that it is tainted by the despoilers, but I would say that we should not let them, those who are long dead, keep our home. My ancestors died to protect it, and I would see it reborn! Let the Tír Croícoill stand again! But not as it were- let it represent who we are now! The Mordag, Keefei and Báirseach, who survived the invaders. The Liadan and Mocháini, who have led us since! The younger clans of the Faolan and Fylani too! Even our kin in Dunland! Most of all, let the Dubhsìthe be acknowledged for their tireless aid! Award to them a seat, even if ceremonial. They are as much of a part of the clans as any, and should be honoured as such!”\n\nTo his speech there was roars of approval. We concurred of course- the choice of a new capital would also be useful as a neutral ground, Alfcud while secure, always had sat uneasy with some as both the seat of the Clanmoot and our clan. We have been allowed to continue our command of the armies to orchestrate this next grand stage of our reclamation. Now, we must reclaim Athámor, and rebuild the Tír Croícoill- for this, we must set a course for the city that the despoilers built upon the sacked remnants of our home. The city that has long stood watch over our lands, crouching over the river as a foreboding sentinel- Tharbad, the ruined great port of the Númenórean whom sacked both our home, and the despoiled the forest we held dear. There shall the foundations of our future be laid.\n\nTO PROGRESS, THE TÍR CROÍCOILL MUST BE CONSTRUCTED IN THARBAD ]]

ENEDWAITH_NEW_DAWN_BODY = [[The sun rises on a new era for us! As its rays illuminate Athámor, it was clear the city had changed. While much of the city has remained as the despoilers constructed it, we have made it our own. The banners of our clans fly throughout, and after many years of being abandoned, the city is once again alive with traders plying their wares and folk greeting each other in the streets. And in the heart of the city stands the Tír Croícoill, the Heart of the Forest. In eld, it was said to have stood in the heart of the Great Forest- a wooden hall within a sacred glade. That era has passed- while we can hope to rejuvenate the Great Forest and heal some scars, we will never truly resurrect what was lost.\n\nThis Tír Croícoill stands for we are now- a confederacy of diverse clans, from all walks of life and varied origins. No longer does blood or lineage define clansmen, but their love and pride in our shared nation. It stands as an impressive feat of stonework, with intricate carvings from the most skilled craftsmen of each clan, and the sun glints over its spires, plated with gold and silver and reflects off its marble facade. Before it, any foreign lord cannot deny that we are equal to them. Within it the Council of Athámor governs, the successor to the Clanmoot and a true ruling council made up of representatives from every clan, even including the Dubhsìthe whom have long guided us and our kin in Dunland. No longer shall we remain bickering and splintered clans, and even now our neighbours have finally started to parley with us seriously on equal grounds. And as their first act, the Ruling Council have issued a declaration, and have proclaimed we are a new nation, building on the foundations of the past- the Confederacy of Athámor!\n\nUntil the present crisis has passed, the Council of Athámor has allowed us to continue to command the now unified military- our pivotal role in events have convinced them that we are best suited to deal with the crisis of the Shadow. With our people's skill in construction being proven with construction of the Tír Croícoill, they have become inspired to perform even greater feats, and we can now fully expand both our cities and castles, freed from our prior restrictions, and with access to the resources of Athámor, we can expand our blacksmiths to forge finer armour. Furthermore, with the declaration of Confederacy of Athámor, efforts have been made to establish a unified military force as an extension of the Clan Heralds, and they can now be recruited if we expand the Clanmoot Mustering Grounds. Finally, a force of brave champions has arisen from the Mordag, with support from the other clans, to once again protect the Tír Croícoill and Athámor as they did in eld. Fiönghan's son, Seitheach has even led the first battalion, acting as an example to the other youths of our nation. We should be proud- we have taken our nation from bickering clansmen with little military infrastructure to a unified nation that can match arms with any. Our future is finally secure!

KHAZAD_PLAYER_START_TITLE = [[It is time... ]]
KHAZAD_START_BODY = [[Durin, Eldest of The Seven Fathers (first awoken of the Children of Aulë), founded Khazad-dûm, the Dwarf Mansions, the heart of our ancient realm. Since the First Age, we had thrived and prospered in these halls, for here we found mithril! Here also was our greatest friendship with the Elves - in their kingdom of Hollin - and our own part in forging the Great Rings. In this wonder lay our undoing, as we dug too deep and awoke Durin's Bane, the spirit of shadow and flame - Valaraukar - a Balrog of Morgoth! A thousand years have passed since Durin's Bane drove us from our ancient home, and now our travel-worn expedition stands inside the Dimrill Gate, the doors of Moria, and the words of friendship are revealed under the moonlight once more. Be aware: evil lurks in the depths, and Durin’s Bane still haunts the deepest reaches of Moria.\n\nIt falls to you, Lord, to return these great halls to their former glory. We are all stout veterans of many battles, but the possibility of reinforcements is slight and we have few or no friends on our borders. We must count on our martial prowess, hard-earned against many a foe, and subtle diplomacy to secure our right to settle once more in these great halls of our forefathers. To the East, we face the Silvan Elves, who still blame our hunger for mithril upon the waking of the Balrog, fiercest of their ancient foes. They will not forgive us this easily. Despite our enmity in these dark times, it would be wise to try to ease the tension and gain their favour, but the decision remains yours, lord.\n\nTo the West and the North, there are the great Mines and Halls of Khazad-dûm and the wonders of the Mithril Forge where once our forefathers' hammers rang as our songs were sung and, from our deep breweries, there flowed rivers of our finest ales. By Sauron's will, those are now in the filth-ridden claws of the Goblins, our hated foe; cowards who will never have forgotten our axes and our battle wrath from the war of Vengeance and the slaughter of Azog upon the stairs of Azanulbizar. There will be no peace with those who slew our great King, Thrór, bearer of one of the last of the Seven Rings. Our axes cry out to drink the sweet nectar of hatred - to feast in the black poison of Goblin blood. With war, pain and wrathful war-mask our axes' thirst for revenge shall never be sated - 'til the scourge of the Misty Mountains is complete, the last shield is smitten, the last severed Goblin-head mounted upon an upthrust stake.\n\nIt would be wise to reconquer these regions, as many of the forges and storerooms remain in working condition - that will be of great help reforging the armour and weapons for our mightiest warriors. Northward along the great Misty Mountains lie strongholds infested by wretched Goblins. One day - when we have regained our former strength – we shall move against these creatures and slay them, cleaning their festering corpses from under and atop those fine mountains!\n\nUntil that day lord, we have to endure many battles while working to restore the halls of Durin and our greatest Sires. Your loyal Dwarves stand ready; awaiting for your orders - ready to follow you on our quest to surpass our former glories, striding forth into the next chapter of our histories, striking out boldly against those who would arrest our great march through the pages of the histories of Middle-earth.\n\nThe time has come to reclaim our rightful home so a trilateral meeting has been called in the town of Dale with the Elves of Thranduil's Realm, the men of Dale and our fellow kin. We will discuss a plan and then gather volunteers for our quest.\n\nWe must move to the town of Dale my Lord, or we shall be late!\n\n“Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!” ]]

MORIA_RECLAIMING_DWARVES_DALEMEETING_BODY = [[We exposed our intentions to the assembly and unfortunately, Thranduil and the men of Dale refused to provide any decisive support to our cause. Almost 40 years has passed since our Lord Balin and his company reclaimed Erebor bringing peace to Northern Rovanion, yet our so-called allies believe our quest to be folly.\n\nNevertheless, we have had better results with our kinsmen. Optimistic Dwarves from Erebor and the Iron Hills have volunteered for our journey.\n\nWithout delay, we must decide upon which course to take to Moria. There are two proposed routes to discuss my Lord, please listen carefully:\n\n – We can use the longer route by first passing along the foothills of the Ered Mithrin, and then turning south through the Anduin Vale. It will be safer, but will take more time, and we have a higher chance of alerting the Misty Mountain Orcs of our mission.\n\n – The second option is through the forest of Mirkwood and Balin knows from experience of the dangers within. As of late the Darkness of Dol Guldor pervades the woods. Many attacks should we expect on this route, but it will be swifter and the Orcs which infest our home will not see us coming.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that while our starting gold is well funded by the left over shares of Balin's Dwarves, the longer the quest, the less gold we shall have to rebuild Moria quickly.\n\nShall we use the longer and safer northern route? This path will delay our arrival to Moria, but it will be safer. (Accept and select the checkmark to take this route.)\n\nOr shall we traverse the dangerous forests southwards? This path will be faster, but is also more dangerous.(Decline and select the 'X' mark to take this route.) ]]

If only they cared more for us reclaimers...\n\nOn the other hand we have had better results with our fellow kinsmen. Optimistic Dwarves from Erebor and the Iron Hills have volunteered and are eager to join our company.\n\nWith or without our allies help we need to discuss a proper plan to achieve our ultimate goal, the primary aim of our mission. We will reclaim Khazad-dûm! Sorry, my Lord, but I forget it is now called Moria in the common tongue.\n\nThere are 2 proposals on the table my Lord, please listen carefully:\n\n – We can take the longer route by first passing along the foothills of the Ered Mithrin, and then going south through the Anduin Vale. It will be safer, but it will take more time, and we have a higher chance of alerting the Misty Mountain Orcs of our mission.\n\n – The other option is through the dangerous forest of Mirkwood. The risk is high, for spiders roam the woods, and Elves could try to stop us. We do not know their intentions. It will be fast though, and the Orcs will never see us coming. ]]

Dwarven opportunists are abandoning projects along the foothills of the Ered Mithrin, the Grey Mountains in the common tongue. We will have to travel soon, and we will have to travel fast. We first march west along the foothills, past the Northmen settlements. If the river south of Dain’s Halls is safe to pass then we will not have to march along the west of the Woodland Realm. Otherwise our travel will be delayed. Once past the river we will go south, along the east bank until we can cross the river. Then we will march past Maethelburg, along the western bank and past the Gladden River. Finally, we will travel through the western most borders of Lothlórien to finally reach the Mountains of Moria, where we will take back the halls of Khazad-dûm!\n\nIs this the route we will take? Will we use the longer but safer route to Moria? (This path will delay our arrival to Moria, but it will be safer) ]]

The dark forests of Mirkwood can be traversed to reach Moria in less time. It is a dangerous path to take, one with many dark spiders, Dol Guldur Orcs and greedy brigands. We will first travel through the southern reaches of the Woodland Realm, past the Elves. We will cross the Old Forest Road, and then delve deep into the Forest before leaving it from one of the western trails. We will finally cross the river, pass Lothlórien and tack back the Mines of Moria!\n\nIs this the route we will take instead? Will we traverse the dangerous forests to get to Moria faster?

We still have to purge the rest of the Orc-filth from the western side of the mountain and in the Deep. We should always be well prepared for counters attack from the Goblins who think they have claim to our home.\n\nLastly, while there has been no sign of Durin's Bane as of yet, we should send word for an old friend: Gandalf, known to us Dwarves as Tharkûn. While that dastardly demon may have slunk back into the dark pits whence he came, there is nothing wrong with having a wizard on our side!\n\nSend a diplomat to visit Bree, Tharkûn was last seen there in the company of a ranger with unusually long legs, so chances are the Bree-folk know where our wizard is. ]]
